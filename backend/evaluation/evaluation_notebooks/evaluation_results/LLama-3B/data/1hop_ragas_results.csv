What is the key outcome of anti-VEGF injections in wet AMD?,"['Anti-VEGF injections are the key treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), significantly improving visual acuity and treating the condition. These injections reduce choroidal neovascularization, fluid buildup, and scarring, thereby preventing further vision loss and promoting better seeing eyes. By targeting the underlying mechanisms of AMD, anti-VEGF injections not only treat disease activity but also improve functional and morphological benefits, making them a cornerstone in managing this debilitating condition.']","Anti-VEGF injections significantly improve visual acuity by reducing choroidal neovascularization, fluid buildup, and scarring in wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD).",The key outcome of anti-VEGF injections is reduced vessel leakage in wet AMD.,0.22742116716869742,0.9092414420697068,0.9096846686747897,1.0,0.9999999999,0.0
