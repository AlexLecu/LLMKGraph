By targeting the root causes of wet AMD, gene therapy may provide a more effective and sustainable treatment option for patients, potentially reducing the need for repeated injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs and improving visual outcomes.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
What is the name of the condition where the retina's blood vessels leak fluid in AMD? a) Retinal vascular leakage b) Choroidal neovascularization c) Retinal tear d) Macular atrophy,a) Retinal vascular leakage,"The condition where the retina's blood vessels leak fluid in Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is closely associated with choroidal neovascularization, a process where new, fragile blood vessels grow into the retina, leading to leakage of fluid and blood. This leakage can cause significant vision loss and is a hallmark of the wet form of AMD. The growth of these new blood vessels is often driven by the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and treatments that target VEGF have been shown to improve outcomes by reducing leakage and slowing disease progression. Overall, the leakage of fluid from the retina's blood vessels is a critical aspect of AMD, particularly in its wet form, and understanding its causes and consequences is essential for developing effective treatments to preserve vision.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,False,False
Which of the following is a common occupational therapy goal for AMD patients? a) Adapting to vision loss b) Increasing muscle strength c) Improving lung capacity d) Enhancing taste perception,a) Adapting to vision loss,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that causes vision loss, affecting daily activities and quality of life. Occupational therapy plays a crucial role in helping patients adapt to this vision loss, focusing on strategies to maintain independence and mobility. The primary goal of occupational therapy for AMD patients is to enable them to cope with their condition, emphasizing adaptation to vision loss rather than solely improving physical attributes like muscle strength or lung capacity, or enhancing sensory perceptions such as taste. By addressing the challenges posed by AMD, occupational therapy aims to improve patients' overall well-being and ability to perform daily tasks, despite their visual impairment. This approach underscores the importance of adapting to vision loss as a fundamental aspect of managing AMD, highlighting its significance in the context of occupational therapy goals.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
