Which factor increases wet AMD risk by promoting VEGF production? a) Smoking b) Drinking water c) Regular exercise d) Low cholesterol,a) Smoking,"Smoking — tobacco use is linked to increased risk of wet AMD and promotes VEGF-driven neovascularization, whereas higher water intake is associated with reduced AMD risk, regular exercise tends to influence retinal health and can improve anti‑angiogenic therapy effects, and low cholesterol is not implicated as a VEGF-promoting risk factor.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to excessive antioxidant deficiency? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with UV exposure,b) No,"Yes — insufficient antioxidants and related nutritional deficiency can drive progression of dry AMD to geographic atrophy; smoking also raises the risk of advanced/late AMD, but progression is not limited to smoking or UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,B,No Help,True,True,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing drusen formation susceptibility? a) Yes b) No c) Only in men d) Only in women,a) Yes,"Yes. A positive family history and genetic factors raise susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration, and AMD commonly manifests with drusen formation, so family history can elevate risk via increased susceptibility to drusen; this effect is not limited to one sex.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reducing photoreceptor regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"Answer: b) No. Anti‑VEGF intravitreal injections treat wet AMD by inhibiting VEGF-driven neovascularization and reducing fluid to improve and preserve vision; the literature links photoreceptor regeneration to regenerative approaches like stem cell and gene therapies rather than to anti‑VEGF therapy, so anti‑VEGF benefits are not mediated by reducing photoreceptor regeneration.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does hypertension worsen AMD by elevating choroidal pressure? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Yes. Hypertension is linked to choroidal dysfunction and choroidopathy and has been associated with increased risk and progression of AMD; by raising systemic/choroidal hydrostatic pressure and impairing choroidal blood flow it can worsen AMD, and this is not limited only to people with diabetes or obesity (though those conditions can further increase risk).",A,B,A,B,B,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by revealing optic nerve damage? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — the Amsler grid can reveal central visual distortions from macular disease such as wet AMD, but it does not detect optic nerve damage, which is evaluated with other examinations and imaging.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by triggering immediate retinal hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"UV and bright light can contribute to retinal damage and are linked to age-related ocular disease and early macular degeneration, but there is no evidence that UV exposure directly triggers immediate retinal hemorrhages to accelerate AMD; retinal bleeding typically occurs with neovascular/exudative AMD or other vascular disorders, and smoking is a separate risk factor that worsens AMD—so the correct answer is b) No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"No — AREDS/antioxidant vitamin supplements (including zinc) can slow progression of dry AMD and reduce the risk of advancing to severe vision loss in appropriate patients, but they do not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial atrophy or geographic atrophy; reversal would require regenerative therapies rather than supplementation alone.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does obesity increase AMD risk by enhancing retinal inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes. Obesity is associated with systemic inflammatory and oxidative changes and with diet‑ or obesity‑driven retinal inflammation, and obesity is linked to higher risk, progression and late stages of AMD, while retinal inflammation is a recognized driver of AMD pathogenesis—together indicating obesity likely increases AMD risk by enhancing retinal inflammation.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by inducing choroidal neovascular leakage? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD involves choroidal neovascularization that can leak or bleed, causing sudden central vision loss; this can occur independent of drusen or UV exposure and is the target of anti‑VEGF treatments.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does diabetes heighten AMD risk by causing direct photoreceptor loss? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"No — diabetes is associated with increased occurrence and progression of AMD largely via vascular and retinal changes rather than by directly killing photoreceptors; photoreceptor loss is described as a consequence of AMD itself, though coexisting vascular risk factors like hypertension can worsen AMD progression.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"Yes — OCT reliably visualizes retinal pigment epithelial detachments and other signs of neovascular activity, so detection of an RPE detachment on OCT supports the diagnosis of wet (neovascular) AMD, usually in conjunction with other OCT indicators of exudation or neovascularization.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does smoking worsen dry AMD by accelerating oxidative damage to the macula? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes — smoking independently increases the risk and progression of dry AMD and worsens macular pathology; because oxidative damage is a key driver of AMD, smoking promotes pathogenic, oxidative injury in the retina and can accelerate macular damage. UV exposure and obesity can also contribute to AMD risk, but smoking itself is a clear, independent aggravating factor.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reversing drusen accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — photodynamic therapy (including verteporfin-based, vascular-targeted PDT) is used to treat the neovascular/wet form of AMD by targeting abnormal choroidal vessels and reducing leakage or hemorrhage, but it is not a treatment that reverses drusen accumulation, which is addressed by different investigational approaches.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does a diet rich in leafy greens reduce AMD risk by repairing choroidal blood vessels? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"Eating lots of leafy greens is linked with a lower risk of AMD and better macular pigment/visual outcomes—likely due to nutrients like lutein—but the benefit is not shown to come from repairing choroidal blood vessels; vascular restoration is addressed by other therapies, and supplements can help slow AMD progression in certain cases.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD cause legal blindness by impairing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Wet (neovascular) AMD can damage and lead to loss of the retinal pigment epithelium, and when RPE repair or regeneration is impaired this worsens central vision and can progress to legal blindness, particularly in advanced or late-stage disease.",A,A,A,A,B,No Help,True,False,False,False
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"No — although altered cholesterol levels (notably higher HDL) are linked with increased AMD risk, the evidence provided does not show that high cholesterol promotes AMD by directly causing retinal pigment epithelial inflammation; retinal pigment epithelial inflammation is implicated in AMD and factors like smoking and diabetes are clearly associated with AMD, but a direct cholesterol→RPE inflammation pathway is not demonstrated.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to excessive retinal hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — excessive retinal hypoxia can drive release of VEGF and other pro‑angiogenic signals that promote pathological vessel growth, causing non‑neovascular (dry) AMD to convert to neovascular (wet) AMD. Drusen are a common risk marker for progression but are not strictly required for hypoxia‑induced conversion, and UV exposure is not a necessary condition for this transition.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does AMD impair depth perception by causing choroidal thinning? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only wet AMD,b) No,"c) Sometimes. AMD is linked with choroidal thinning and with impaired spatial/central vision, and thinning can alter choroidal perfusion, so depth perception may be affected in some patients depending on AMD subtype and disease stage rather than universally or only in the wet form.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing subretinal fluid leakage? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with surgery,a) Yes,"Yes — intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy is an established treatment for neovascular/wet AMD that reduces subretinal fluid, often producing anatomical stabilization and improved visual outcomes, although some patients may have partial or no response and long‑term efficacy can decline in certain cases.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing direct retinal thinning? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Family history clearly raises the risk of AMD (with smoking and other factors also aggravating risk), but retinal thinning is described as a manifestation of AMD itself (for example in geographic atrophy or non‑exudative AMD) rather than a direct consequence of having a family history; in other words, family history predisposes to AMD which can lead to retinal thinning, but it does not directly cause retinal thinning.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD distort vision by inducing subretinal hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes. Neovascular (wet/exudative) AMD often produces subretinal or submacular hemorrhages that can distort and rapidly worsen central vision; drusen and systemic factors like hypertension may increase risk or aggravate progression, but subretinal bleeding and visual distortion can occur as a direct consequence of wet AMD itself.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it avoids retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"c) Sometimes. Dry (atrophic) AMD involves degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium, and the lack of effective RPE repair contributes to its usually slower, progressive course compared with neovascular forms, but progression is variable and influenced by multiple factors, which is why RPE-repair strategies are being investigated.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,True,False,False,False
Can hypertension exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Yes. Hypertension is linked to increased occurrence and progression of AMD, can impair choroidal circulation and promote neovascular changes that commonly produce retinal pigment epithelial detachment, and this effect is not limited to patients with diabetes or obesity, although those conditions independently raise AMD risk.",A,A,A,A,B,No Help,False,True,False,False
Does smoking worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,Yes — smoking is linked to increased risk and progression of AMD and is associated with damage to the retinal pigment epithelium and microvascular aging that can promote retinal hypoxia and drive neovascular changes; this adverse effect is not limited to concurrent UV exposure or high cholesterol.,A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can OCT detect early dry AMD by identifying changes in drusen morphology? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with fluid,a) Yes,"Yes — spectral-domain optical coherence tomography can visualize drusen and subtle changes in their morphology as well as outer retinal and RPE alterations, allowing detection and diagnosis of early dry AMD even in the absence of fluid.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by reversing choroidal neovascularization? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"Partially — intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections effectively suppress and often induce regression of choroidal neovascular membranes, reducing leakage and fluid and improving or stabilizing vision and disease activity in wet/neovascular AMD, but they do not reliably or permanently eliminate all established neovascular tissue or reverse scarring, especially in more advanced lesions.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,True,False
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by elevating oxidative stress in the retina? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes — diabetes-related retinal disease involves the retina, and oxidative stress is present in and drives AMD pathogenesis, so diabetes can plausibly contribute to AMD by elevating retinal oxidative stress.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — the dry (atrophic/non‑neovascular) form of AMD progresses to geographic atrophy through atrophic loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors rather than by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages, which are more characteristic of the neovascular (exudative) form.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can AMD increase fall risk by reducing central visual acuity? a) Yes b) No c) Only with wet AMD d) Only with dry AMD,a) Yes,"Yes — age-related macular degeneration, whether wet or dry, can impair or reduce central visual acuity and central vision, and this loss of central vision is linked to mobility problems and an increased risk of falls.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"No — while UV/solar exposure is linked to increased risk of age-related ocular disease and early AMD, and AMD can present with retinal pigment epithelial detachment (with smoking known to worsen AMD), there is no evidence that UV exposure directly causes immediate retinal pigment epithelial detachment or that such an effect is confined only to smokers or only to light-eyed individuals.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes. The neovascular (wet) form of AMD can produce abnormal new vessels that leak and bleed, damaging the retinal pigment epithelium and leading to scarring and fibrosis that often causes rapid, sometimes irreversible central vision loss; drusen and hypertension can influence risk and progression but are not required for wet AMD to induce RPE scarring and sudden vision loss.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing retinal hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"Partially: antioxidant-rich diets and antioxidant supplements can reduce oxidative stress and are linked to lower risk or slower progression of AMD, but there’s no clear evidence that they directly reverse retinal hypoxia, so any protective effect is likely indirect rather than a direct correction of retinal oxygenation.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing choroidal neovascular activity? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes. Smoking is linked to the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration and is associated with the neovascular (wet) form, aggravating disease activity and increased choroidal neovascular activity and worsening treatment outcomes, so it can exacerbate wet AMD independently of UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD affect color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Answer: b) No. Dry (atrophic) AMD involves degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium rather than regeneration, and this RPE loss can impair color perception and central vision—most prominently in advanced geographic atrophy.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with anti-VEGF,a) Yes,"No. Wet AMD is driven by VEGF-mediated neovascularization with retinal and RPE involvement, and intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy is the established treatment that reduces retinal/RPE edema and improves anatomy and vision; photodynamic therapy is not shown here as a means to reduce RPE edema.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"Answer: b) No. Obesity is linked to higher risk and progression of AMD and harms retinal health through inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic pathways, but the evidence shows retinal pigment epithelial atrophy as a feature of AMD rather than something obesity immediately causes.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD impair reading by causing retinal pigment epithelial detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD often causes retinal pigment epithelial detachment, which can worsen visual acuity and lead to difficulty reading, and this effect is part of wet AMD itself rather than being limited only to cases with drusen or smoking.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol contribute to AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with hypertension d) Only with diabetes,a) Yes,"Yes — elevated cholesterol (including high HDL levels) is linked to increased AMD risk, and lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium is implicated in AMD pathogenesis, supporting that high cholesterol can promote RPE lipid deposition that contributes to AMD.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by fully repairing retinal pigment epithelium? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"No — AREDS supplements, including zinc, can reduce progression risk and have beneficial, partly protective effects on AMD and on RPE cells, but they do not fully repair damaged retinal pigment epithelium; their benefit is mainly to slow or lessen progression rather than regenerate lost RPE.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Answer: b) No. Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD causes central blind spots via exudation, neovascularization and damage or loss of the retinal pigment epithelium leading to vision loss, rather than by inducing RPE regeneration; treatments aim to prevent degeneration or replace damaged RPE.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal pigment epithelial oxidative stress? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes. Family history and genetic risk factors can raise the risk of AMD by making the retinal pigment epithelium more vulnerable to oxidative stress, a key driver of AMD; this mechanism is not limited to cases with smoking or UV exposure, although those exposures can further increase oxidative injury.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive dietary cholesterol alone? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Answer: b) No. Excessive dietary cholesterol is associated with AMD risk and oxidative stress and may contribute to progression, but conversion from dry to neovascular (wet) AMD is driven by pathological angiogenesis and multiple interacting factors—such as obesity, inflammation, genetics, and other systemic risks—so cholesterol alone is not sufficient.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"Yes — intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are an established treatment for neovascular (wet) AMD; by suppressing choroidal neovascular activity they reduce exudation and lesion activity, which can lead to resolution of associated retinal and retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages and improve vision. Photodynamic therapy can also help control hemorrhage in selected cases and is sometimes combined with anti‑VEGF, but anti‑VEGF remains the primary therapy.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does UV light increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"No — while UV/solar radiation is linked to ocular damage and has been been associated with early AMD and other age‑related eye diseases, there is no evidence here that UV increases AMD risk specifically by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration; some data even suggest intermittent UV can improve RPE cellular phenotype, and there’s no clear indication the effect is limited to light‑colored eyes.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD affect face recognition by causing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD can lead to retinal pigment epithelial scarring and fibrosis from chronic leakage and hemorrhage of neovascular lesions, producing RPE loss and central vision impairment that impairs face recognition; drusen and smoking are risk factors for AMD but scarring and resulting face‑recognition problems can occur with wet AMD itself, not only when drusen or smoking are present.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does hypertension worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"No — hypertension is linked to worsened AMD and early progression and can alter RPE/Bruch’s complex volume, but there’s no evidence here that hypertension worsens AMD by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; RPE proliferation is described as part of AMD itself, while diabetes and lipid factors are separate risk modifiers.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with obesity d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — smoking is a well-established risk factor that worsens age-related macular degeneration; it promotes oxidative stress and lipid oxidation and is associated with changes in the retinal pigment epithelium and accumulation of subretinal/sub‑RPE lipid deposits (drusen), which contribute to AMD progression independent of obesity or UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD cause gradual vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — dry (atrophic) AMD produces gradual central vision loss through degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors, not by inducing RPE repair.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can OCT confirm wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"No — OCT cannot confirm wet AMD simply by detecting retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation; lipid accumulation and drusen are associated with AMD, but wet (neovascular) AMD is diagnosed by signs of choroidal neovascularization and exudation, which require detection of fluid, RPE elevation or vascular flow changes (often with OCT-A or complementary imaging) rather than lipid deposits alone.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,False,False
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only with hypertension d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Diabetes is linked to a higher risk of AMD overall, but the data do not support that it increases AMD risk specifically by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages; those hemorrhages are more directly associated with neovascular AMD, hypertension, diabetic retinopathy and anticoagulation, so the best answer is b) No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD often produces exudation and edema involving the retinal pigment epithelium and retina, which can cause sudden vision changes; this can occur with or without drusen and is not specifically dependent on UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Family history does increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration, but there is no indication here that it does so by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair; inherited susceptibility and other risk modifiers such as obesity influence AMD risk through different pathways.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"Yes—by suppressing neovascular activity in wet AMD, anti‑VEGF therapy reduces exudation, hemorrhage and subretinal fluid (drivers of RPE scarring) and can therefore help stabilize the disease and improve anatomical and visual outcomes; however responses vary, some patients have partial or waning responses, and photodynamic therapy may be used as an adjunct in selected cases rather than being universally required.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does smoking increase dry AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"No — smoking does increase the risk of dry AMD, but the evidence links it to RPE dysfunction, atrophy and other degenerative changes rather than directly causing retinal pigment epithelial edema; retinal edema is more characteristic of exudative/neovascular disease, and the smoking–dry AMD link is not limited to co‑exposure to UV or high cholesterol.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD impair driving by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD can produce lipid-rich sub‑RPE deposits and RPE damage (including drusen and other subretinal/sub‑RPE deposits), and these changes contribute to central vision loss and measurable impairments in driving performance; this is not limited only to cases with drusen or only seen in smokers.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"No. The evidence links altered cholesterol (including high HDL) to AMD risk and shows that RPE dysfunction and proliferation are involved in AMD and that diabetes and hypertension can influence AMD progression, but there is no indication that high cholesterol worsens AMD by inducing RPE repair—no causal pathway supporting cholesterol-caused RPE repair as a mechanism for exacerbation is shown.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by reversing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"AREDS-type antioxidant and zinc supplementation can lower the risk and slow progression of AMD and zinc does affect RPE biology, but there’s no clear evidence that these supplements reliably reverse RPE swelling/elevation seen in AMD; they may therefore mitigate risk or progression but do not directly resolve RPE swelling — c) Partially.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Answer: b) No. Wet (neovascular) AMD causes RPE elevation, damage or loss and resultant central vision and spatial perception deficits, but it does not produce depth-perception problems by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Obesity is linked to increased risk and progression of AMD and alters lipid metabolism in ways that promote lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, so obesity can worsen AMD by increasing RPE lipid deposition, and this effect is not limited to cases with diabetes or smoking.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No—dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can progress to geographic atrophy, which is marked by loss and dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors leading to central vision loss; this progression is driven by RPE degeneration/dysfunction rather than being caused by RPE lipid repair, and current approaches focus on preserving or replacing RPE.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with anti-VEGF,a) Yes,"The available evidence links retinal hypoxia and VEGF-driven neovascularization as the key drivers of wet AMD and supports anti-VEGF treatments for this condition, but there is no indication here that photodynamic therapy acts by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia to treat wet AMD—so the correct choice is b) No.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"UV and visible light—particularly blue light—can damage the retinal pigment epithelium through oxidative stress, lipofuscin accumulation and cell death and thereby contribute to AMD risk, but there is no clear evidence that UV exposure increases AMD specifically by causing RPE lipid regeneration; effects depend on exposure patterns (intermittent exposure can have different outcomes) and there’s no demonstrated restriction of risk to light‑colored eyes.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes.

Can OCT detect early AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"No — spectral-domain OCT can detect structural signs of early AMD (drusen, outer retinal and RPE changes, thinning or RPE elevations) but it does not directly visualize retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia; hypoxic effects are inferred from secondary structural or neovascular changes rather than directly imaged by OCT.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,False,False
Does diabetes exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with hypertension d) Only with smoking,b) No,"The evidence provided links smoking and hypertension to worsening AMD and highlights retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction in AMD, but it does not support diabetes causing RPE lipid repair as a mechanism that exacerbates AMD; therefore the best answer is No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"No — neovascular (wet) AMD can produce sudden vision changes, but these are usually caused by exudation or submacular hemorrhage rather than by retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation; lipid deposits are part of AMD pathogenesis but are not the typical mechanism for abrupt vision loss, and this phenomenon is not limited to presence of drusen or to UV exposure.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,True,False,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"No — family history is linked to higher AMD risk, but the evidence does not show it directly causes retinal pigment epithelial repair; RPE proliferation is a feature of AMD itself, so any connection would be indirect or unproven.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"No — anti‑VEGF injections effectively treat the neovascular/exudative features of wet AMD by suppressing abnormal vessel growth and fluid, improving anatomical and visual outcomes, but they do not reduce retinal pigment epithelial lipid/drusen deposits, which reflect different disease processes and are addressed by other approaches.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"No — smoking is clearly linked to increased and worsened AMD and can alter retinal pigment epithelium structure and function, but the evidence here does not support that smoking increases AMD risk by causing RPE lipid regeneration; instead it points to smoking worsening AMD and affecting RPE in other damaging ways, with no indication that the proposed lipid-regeneration mechanism requires UV exposure or high cholesterol.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD impair driving by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD produces exudation and leaky vessels that can cause retinal and retinal pigment epithelial edema/elevation, leading to central vision loss and impaired driving; drusen or smoking may influence risk but are not required for this impairment.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"Although HDL/cholesterol levels are linked to AMD risk and the retinal pigment epithelium is central to AMD pathology, the provided evidence does not support a causal pathway in which high cholesterol exacerbates AMD by inducing RPE lipid repair; diabetes and hypertension are shown as independent risk contributors, so the best answer is b) No.",B,A,B,A,B,Positive,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"Partially. AREDS-style antioxidant and zinc-containing supplements can reduce AMD risk and slow disease progression and zinc specifically influences RPE cells and oxidative/lipid stress, but there’s no clear evidence that these supplements reliably reverse established retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation—they mitigate risk and progression rather than directly clear lipid deposits.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Wet (neovascular) AMD commonly impairs central vision and spatial perception through neovascularization, exudation and damage or loss of the retinal pigment epithelium, which can reduce depth perception, but there is no support here that it does so by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration—so the answer is No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — obesity is associated with higher risk and worsened progression of AMD and promotes pathological processes like neovascularization and late-stage disease that lead to retinal pigment epithelial proliferation and scarring, so it can worsen RPE scarring independently rather than only in the presence of diabetes or smoking.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — dry (non‑neovascular/atrophic) AMD progresses to geographic atrophy through degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors, not from RPE edema, which is more characteristic of exudative/neovascular disease.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with anti-VEGF,a) Yes,"No — photodynamic therapy does not treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits. Wet AMD is driven by VEGF‑mediated neovascularization and is mainly managed with intravitreal anti‑VEGF treatments; lipid and oxidized lipid deposits contribute to disease progression and oxidative‑stress–targeting strategies are considered separately, while photodynamic therapy, when used, acts on abnormal vessels rather than clearing RPE lipid deposits.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"No — ultraviolet/visible light exposure is generally linked to retinal pigment epithelium damage (oxidative stress, cell death, impaired phagocytosis, lipofuscin accumulation and related dysfunction) that can promote age‑related macular degeneration, and there is no clear evidence that UV increases AMD risk by inducing RPE lipid “repair”; isolated experimental reports of intermittent UV improving certain high‑risk RPE cell phenotypes do not support a general lipid‑repair mechanism nor an eye‑color‑specific effect.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes.

Does hypertension contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"No — hypertension is implicated in AMD and can worsen its progression through vascular and RPE structural effects (for example on the choriocapillaris and RPE volume), but there is no evidence here that hypertension specifically causes retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration; lipid-related AMD risk appears linked to high-density lipoprotein levels and diabetes is an independent risk factor.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can smoking increase AMD severity by promoting retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes. Smoking is consistently linked to worse and advanced forms of age-related macular degeneration and to damage and volume loss in the retinal pigment epithelium, while AMD itself is associated with retinal/RPE edema, so smoking can promote RPE edema and thereby increase AMD severity rather than only acting via UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD impair reading by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,a) Yes,"Yes — dry (atrophic) AMD commonly features lipid-rich drusen beneath or within the retinal pigment epithelium that disrupt RPE and macular function, leading to central vision loss and difficulty reading, with severity and functional impact increasing as the disease progresses.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"Yes — optical coherence tomography can reveal retinal pigment epithelium elevation/edema and associated macular fluid and neovascular changes, allowing detection and diagnosis of wet (neovascular) AMD.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,False,False,False,False
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with hypertension d) Only with smoking,b) No,"No — diabetes is linked to increased AMD risk and affects the retina, and AMD involves retinal pigment epithelium pathology, but the available evidence does not support diabetes increasing AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration; hypertension and smoking are independent, established risk modifiers.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD can produce chronic CNV leakage or submacular hemorrhage that induces retinal pigment epithelial scarring and fibrosis, causing RPE loss and acute or sudden visual changes; this can occur regardless of drusen or UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"No — a positive family history is a clear risk factor for AMD and RPE dysfunction/proliferation is implicated in the disease, but there is no evidence here that family history elevates AMD risk specifically by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration; obesity is an independent modifier of risk.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"No — anti‑VEGF therapy improves wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD by blocking abnormal blood-vessel growth and reducing exudation and subretinal fluid, which yields visual and anatomic benefits, but it is not shown to act by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation; lipid buildup is implicated in AMD pathogenesis and is targeted by different lipid-focused strategies rather than by anti‑VEGF (and photodynamic therapy is a separate treatment, not a required adjunct for lipid reduction).",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"b) No. Smoking is consistently linked to higher risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration and to harmful changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (such as volume loss and abnormal proliferation), but the evidence does not support that smoking increases AMD risk by promoting RPE lipid repair; UV exposure and cholesterol are separate risk factors rather than required co‑drivers of a smoking‑induced RPE lipid‑repair mechanism.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing choroidal neovascularization? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes — smoking is linked to increased risk and progression of age‑related macular degeneration and is associated with the neovascular (wet) form characterized by choroidal neovascularization, with current smoking aggravating disease and worse outcomes regardless of UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with diabetes,a) Yes,"Yes. Accumulation of lipid-rich deposits beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (drusen/oxidized lipids) can drive progression from dry (atrophic) AMD to neovascular (wet) AMD, with RPE elevation/loss and exudation marking the conversion; smoking and diabetes can increase the risk or accelerate progression but are not required for the switch.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Does family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Only in women d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes.

Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial damage? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — anti‑VEGF injections effectively control the neovascular activity in wet AMD, reducing fluid and often improving or stabilizing vision, but they do not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial damage; earlier treatment can limit further injury and preserve function, but lost RPE/atrophy is not restored by these therapies.",B,D,B,D,B,Positive,False,False,True,False
Does high blood pressure worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Yes — hypertension can worsen AMD and is associated with retinal hemorrhages; however, retinal pigment epithelial bleeding is most directly linked to neovascular (exudative) AMD, and high blood pressure likely contributes indirectly (via impaired choroidal blood flow and hypertensive retinal changes) rather than being the sole direct cause, with smoking and diabetes also modifying AMD risk and hemorrhage likelihood.",B,A,B,A,B,Positive,False,True,False,False
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by assessing retinal pigment epithelial lipid changes? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — the Amsler grid detects functional central visual distortions and can flag AMD-related vision changes, but it does not assess retinal pigment epithelial lipid changes, which require structural/imaging evaluation.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Only with light eyes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Answer: b) No. While light—especially high‑energy blue light—can damage retinal pigment epithelium and contribute to AMD, the available links do not support UV exposure accelerating AMD specifically by causing RPE swelling; intermittent UV exposure has even been reported to improve certain high‑risk RPE phenotypes, smoking independently worsens AMD risk, and there’s no evidence here for an eye‑color–specific effect.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by repairing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"c) Partially — AREDS formulations (antioxidants ± zinc) slow progression of dry AMD and support retinal pigment epithelial health by reducing oxidative stress and related damage, and zinc in particular influences RPE and lipid-related pathways, but these supplements do not reliably reverse or fully repair established lipid accumulation in the RPE.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Does obesity heighten AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes — obesity is associated with a higher risk of AMD, including progression to late/neovascular forms, and is linked to pathological retinal angiogenesis and microvascular changes that can lead to retinal pigment epithelial damage and scarring; diabetes and hypertension also modify AMD risk but obesity alone is implicated.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD commonly produces retinal pigment epithelial detachments that can compromise visual acuity and, when complicated by bleeding or RPE tears, lead to sudden vision loss, so the correct answer is Yes.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Answer: No (b).

Does smoking worsen dry AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial oxidative stress? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"Yes — smoking increases oxidative stress in the retinal pigment epithelium, promoting RPE dysfunction and cell degeneration that accelerate dry AMD progression, and this harmful effect is not limited to cases with UV exposure or high cholesterol.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — photodynamic therapy can treat neovascular/wet AMD and related choroidal neovascular lesions and may improve vision, but it does not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial and outer retinal atrophy, which is generally degenerative; other strategies (cell replacement or growth‑factor approaches) are aimed at preventing or addressing RPE loss.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by eliminating retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"Partially — eating leafy greens supplies carotenoids, antioxidants, vitamins and other nutrients that boost macular pigment and lower AMD risk and can slow disease progression, but it does not directly clear or eliminate the sub‑retinal/retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits (drusen); nutritional supplements can further modify progression in some patients but are not a guaranteed means to remove existing deposits.",C,C,C,C,B,No Help,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — neovascular (wet) AMD can certainly lead to legal blindness, especially in late stages, but this results from RPE damage or loss, photoreceptor death and choroidal neovascularization with exudation and scarring rather than retinal pigment epithelial ""repair.""",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — elevated blood lipids, including altered high‑density lipoprotein levels, are linked to higher AMD risk, and retinal pigment epithelium lipid accumulation (drusen/lipid deposits) is implicated in the disease process rather than the risk being limited only to diabetes or smoking.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to excessive choroidal neovascular activity? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can progress to wet AMD when excessive choroidal neovascular activity (pathologic angiogenesis/VEGF‑driven growth) causes exudation and new vessel formation; drusen are common and increase the risk of progression but are not strictly required, and UV exposure alone is not the defining cause.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does AMD impair color perception by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only wet AMD,b) No,"No. AMD impairs color and central vision by damaging or causing loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying retina; it does not induce RPE regeneration—regeneration is a therapeutic aim (e.g., stem cell or transplantation approaches), while wet AMD in particular often involves RPE disruption.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with surgery,a) Yes,"Yes — intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy is an effective treatment for neovascular (wet) AMD that reduces intraretinal and subretinal fluid and retinal edema (including RPE‑associated fluid/elevations), helping to stabilize the disease and improve visual outcomes; responses can vary (partial or nonresponders and some loss of efficacy over time), and benefit is not limited to requiring surgery or strictly to very early stages.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"No — a family history raises the risk of developing AMD, but it does so by genetic and disease susceptibility rather than by directly causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages; those hemorrhages are a consequence of advanced (especially neovascular/exudative) AMD, not the usual mechanism by which family history increases risk.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD distort vision by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes.

Does dry AMD progress slowly because it avoids retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"Yes — dry (atrophic) AMD typically progresses more slowly because it lacks the exudation and retinal pigment epithelium elevation/swelling characteristic of neovascular (wet) AMD; instead it shows drusen and gradual RPE atrophy, which leads to a slower, progressive loss of central vision over time.",A,B,A,B,B,Negative,True,False,False,False
Can high blood pressure exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"High blood pressure can worsen age-related macular degeneration through impaired choroidal blood flow and disrupted vascular homeostasis, but there is no support here that it exacerbates AMD by triggering retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair, so the correct answer is No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does smoking worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"Yes.

Can OCT detect early dry AMD by identifying retinal pigment epithelial thinning? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with fluid,a) Yes,"Yes — spectral-domain OCT can detect early dry AMD by visualizing outer retinal and RPE thinning, so it can identify early changes and is not limited to late stages or cases with fluid.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections treat wet/neovascular AMD by suppressing abnormal blood vessel growth and reducing exudation and retinal fluid to improve vision, but they do not remove or reverse retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits (drusen), which are a separate pathological feature requiring other approaches.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"No — the available information links retinal pigment epithelium inflammation and AMD and highlights smoking and hypertension as contributing factors, but it does not show diabetes as a contributor to AMD via increased RPE inflammation.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — dry (non‑neovascular/atrophic) AMD can progress to geographic atrophy, but geographic atrophy reflects loss and degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors rather than RPE regeneration, and it typically occurs in the atrophic/late stages of the disease.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can AMD increase fall risk by impairing retinal pigment epithelial function? a) Yes b) No c) Only with wet AMD d) Only with dry AMD,a) Yes,"Yes — AMD can increase fall risk by impairing retinal pigment epithelial function, and this mechanism is most characteristic of dry AMD where RPE dysfunction, atrophy and cell loss lead to photoreceptor and central vision loss that impairs gait, spatial perception and mobility; wet AMD can also involve RPE damage, but RPE dysfunction and atrophy are particularly prominent in the dry form.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"No — the information provided does not support UV exposure directly accelerating AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages.

Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"Antioxidant-rich diets and antioxidant supplements are associated with reduced AMD risk and can improve or slow progression, but the evidence does not show that their protective effect works by reversing retinal pigment epithelial swelling specifically; benefits appear tied to reducing oxidative damage and are most clearly supported when given as targeted supplements rather than solely from diet.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes — smoking is linked to increased risk and worse progression of neovascular (wet) AMD, and because AMD involves subretinal/retinal pigment epithelial lipid and oxidized lipid deposits that worsen disease, smoking’s oxidative, inflammatory, and RPE-altering effects can promote those harmful deposits and thereby exacerbate wet AMD independent of UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD affect color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"b) No. Dry (atrophic) AMD can reduce color perception because RPE degeneration and loss lead to central visual impairment, but the condition is characterized by RPE damage/atrophy rather than by retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair, and treatments aim to replace or support damaged RPE rather than rely on lipid repair.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False

Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by reversing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"Answer: b) No. AREDS supplementation (including zinc) can slow progression in intermediate AMD and support retinal pigment epithelium health, but there is no evidence that these supplements reverse retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages, which are typically due to neovascular or vascular causes and require targeted ophthalmic treatments.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD produces blind spots through choroidal neovascularization, exudation and damage or loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, not by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration; lipid-rich deposits (drusen/subretinal deposits) can be present in AMD but represent accumulation rather than regenerative lipid production by the RPE.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — a positive family history raises the risk of AMD, and AMD (especially neovascular/exudative disease) commonly causes retinal pigment epithelial damage and scarring, so familial predisposition can increase the likelihood of RPE scarring rather than being limited only to smoking or UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Sometimes — dry AMD can convert to neovascular (wet) AMD, and dysfunction or abnormal behavior of the retinal pigment epithelium is implicated in progression, but excessive lipid “repair” is not shown as the sole mechanism; systemic factors such as obesity and other risk modifiers can increase the likelihood of progression but are not required for conversion.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,True,True,False,False

Smoking is associated with greater risk and progression of AMD, including late-stage and geographic atrophy, and is linked to RPE volume loss and increased retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, so it can exacerbate AMD independently rather than only in the setting of UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD cause gradual vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,a) Yes,"Yes.

Can OCT confirm wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"Only late stages (c). OCT can reveal RPE scarring and fibrotic changes that arise from chronic CNV and hemorrhage in neovascular (wet) AMD, so detection of RPE scar on OCT supports late or chronic neovascular disease but by itself does not confirm active/wet AMD without signs of ongoing exudation or active CNV.",C,B,C,B,A,No Help,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD is associated with lipid-rich deposits beneath the RPE (drusen/sub‑RPE deposits) and with RPE elevation or loss, and it commonly causes vision changes — sometimes sudden when exudation or submacular hemorrhage occurs — so this can happen beyond just UV exposure or a narrowly drusen‑only context.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,True,False,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"Anti-VEGF treatment stabilizes wet (neovascular) AMD by suppressing choroidal neovascularization and reducing exudation, improving anatomic and visual outcomes, but it does not reduce lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium—RPE lipid buildup is part of AMD pathogenesis addressed by other lipid‑targeted or RPE‑directed strategies, while photodynamic therapy is an alternative vascular treatment rather than a method to clear RPE lipids.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Does smoking increase dry AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"No — smoking does increase the risk and progression of dry AMD, but the evidence points to RPE dysfunction, atrophy, impaired clearance and inflammatory pathways rather than smoking specifically causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration; this smoking-related risk is not limited to cases with UV exposure or only seen with high cholesterol, though both lipid abnormalities and light/UV exposure are independent AMD risk factors.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD impair driving by causing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD can cause retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and central vision loss, and those RPE/central vision changes are associated with reduced driving performance and difficulty driving, so wet AMD can impair driving regardless of drusen or smoking.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"No — while altered cholesterol (including high HDL) is associated with increased AMD risk and AMD is linked with retinal pigment epithelium changes, the available connections do not support a specific causal pathway in which high cholesterol exacerbates AMD by directly driving retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration; other factors like diabetes and hypertension are independently associated with AMD but do not make that proposed mechanism true.",B,A,B,A,B,Positive,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"No — AREDS‑style nutritional supplements (antioxidants, vitamins and zinc) can reduce AMD progression risk and influence RPE biology and oxidative lipid processes, but they are not known to clear or reverse established retinal pigment epithelial/sub‑RPE lipid deposits.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — neovascular (wet) AMD can impair depth perception because central macular and RPE damage produce central vision loss and poor spatial perception, but the evidence points to RPE loss, elevation, or dysfunction as the culprit rather than any process of retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Obesity is associated with higher risk and worse progression of AMD and can exacerbate retinal and RPE pathology—systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and microvascular/angiogenic changes linked to obesity promote vascular leakage and edema—so it can worsen RPE-related edema independently of diabetes or smoking, although those conditions also raise risk.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can and often does progress to geographic atrophy, especially as the disease advances, with GA marked by loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors; however, the available information does not support retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration as the cause of that progression, so the correct answer is No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with anti-VEGF,a) Yes,"No — while lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium is implicated in AMD and wet (neovascular) disease is driven by VEGF and effectively treated with anti‑VEGF therapies, there is no supporting evidence here that photodynamic therapy treats wet AMD by reducing RPE lipid accumulation; current management focuses on anti‑VEGF approaches for neovascular disease.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by causing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes.

Can smoking increase AMD severity by promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,Yes — smoking is a clear aggravator of age-related macular degeneration and can promote retinal pigment epithelial lipid and oxidized deposits that drive disease progression; this effect is not limited only to UV exposure or only to obesity.,A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can OCT detect early AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"Yes. Spectral-domain OCT can detect early AMD by revealing sub‑RPE deposits and retinal pigment epithelium changes consistent with lipid accumulation; OCT shows early outer retinal thinning and abnormalities even in drusen‑free areas, so detection is not limited to late stages or only when drusen are present.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does smoking increase AMD risk by enhancing retinal pigment epithelial inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes — smoking is consistently linked to higher risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration, and evidence showing smoking-related RPE changes and inflammatory markers in the RPE supports that smoking can promote AMD via enhanced RPE inflammation, not only in the presence of UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial repair alone? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"No — progression from dry to wet AMD isn’t driven by excessive retinal pigment epithelial repair alone; while RPE dysfunction and proliferative responses are implicated in neovascular changes, the shift to wet (neovascular) AMD is multifactorial, with environmental and systemic factors such as smoking and metabolic comorbidities influencing the risk rather than RPE repair by itself.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing retinal pigment epithelial susceptibility to oxidative stress? a) Yes b) No c) Only in men d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Family history is a recognized risk factor for AMD and oxidative stress and retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction both contribute to AMD pathogenesis, but the provided evidence does not show that family history specifically increases RPE susceptibility to oxidative stress; therefore the best choice is b) No.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — anti‑VEGF injections effectively treat the neovascular (wet/exudative) aspects of AMD by reducing choroidal neovascularization, fluid, and improving vision, but they do not reverse retinal pigment epithelial lipid/drusen accumulation, which is part of a different pathogenic pathway addressed by other therapeutic strategies.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does hypertension worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Yes.

Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by measuring retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Answer: b) No. The Amsler grid is a simple subjective screen for central visual distortions and can flag macular problems including wet AMD, but it does not measure retinal pigment epithelial regeneration—assessment of RPE status and definitive diagnosis of wet AMD require clinical examination and imaging.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with light eyes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"No — while light exposure, especially blue light, is linked to retinal pigment epithelium damage, oxidative stress, and AMD progression and lipid/oxidized lipid deposits are implicated in worsening AMD, there is no indication that UV exposure specifically causes RPE lipid deposits to accelerate AMD; in fact intermittent UV exposure has been reported to improve some high‑risk RPE phenotypes, and smoking remains a clear independent aggravating risk factor.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by regenerating retinal pigment epithelial cells? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"No — AREDS-type vitamin and zinc supplements can slow progression of dry AMD and reduce risk of vision loss, but they do not regenerate lost retinal pigment epithelial cells; zinc can affect RPE function and biology, but true restoration of RPE requires cell‑based or regenerative therapies rather than AREDS supplements.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does obesity heighten AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Obesity is linked to higher AMD risk via inflammation, oxidative stress, microvascular aging and other harmful retinal effects, but the evidence provided does not show obesity specifically driving retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia as the causal pathway; vascular comorbidities like diabetes and hypertension have clearer ties to hypoxic and vascular mechanisms in AMD—so the answer is No.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD can lead to retinal/RPE and submacular hemorrhages, and such hemorrhages can cause sudden vision loss; this can occur with wet AMD independent of drusen or UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration, but the provided evidence does not support the specific mechanism of diabetes increasing AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair; smoking and obesity are documented independent risk/aggravating factors for AMD.

Does smoking worsen dry AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"Smoking is clearly linked to higher risk and progression of dry AMD, and lipid accumulation in RPE cells is implicated in AMD pathogenesis, but there is no direct evidence here that smoking specifically increases retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation or that this occurs only with UV exposure or high cholesterol—so the best answer is No.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — photodynamic therapy is used to treat the neovascular (wet) form of AMD by targeting abnormal choroidal blood vessels and can improve visual outcomes, but it does not remove or reverse retinal pigment epithelial lipid (drusen) deposits, which are a separate pathological feature of AMD.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by repairing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"Partially: diets rich in leafy greens are linked to lower risk and slower AMD progression by supplying carotenoids, antioxidants, vitamins, minerals and by supporting macular pigment and overall retinal health, but the evidence does not show they directly repair retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia; targeted nutritional supplementation can provide additional benefit in some cases.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD can and often does lead to legal blindness through neovascularization, exudation, RPE loss and photoreceptor degeneration, while regeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium is a reparative process targeted by therapies to preserve or restore vision rather than a mechanism that causes legal blindness.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes. Hypoxia of the retinal pigment epithelium can trigger abnormal vessel growth and increased vascular permeability that lead to neovascular (wet) AMD, so dry (atrophic) AMD with RPE dysfunction can progress to wet AMD; drusen commonly mark higher risk but are not strictly required for conversion, and UV exposure is not a necessary condition.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does AMD impair color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only wet AMD,b) No,"No. AMD impairs color perception through macular and retinal pigment epithelium damage and loss—especially in neovascular/wet and atrophic forms—leading to central vision and color deficits; RPE ""repair"" or proliferation is not described as the mechanism causing color impairment.",B,C,B,C,B,Positive,False,False,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial fluid leakage? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with surgery,a) Yes,"Yes — intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy is the standard nonsurgical treatment for neovascular (wet) AMD and works to reduce subretinal and retinal pigment epithelium–related fluid leakage, stabilizing anatomy and improving visual outcomes, with earlier treatment generally leading to better results.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Family history is a known risk factor for age-related macular degeneration, and AMD can present with retinal pigment epithelial edema or other RPE changes; therefore family history may be associated with cases where RPE edema occurs as part of AMD but does not directly or universally cause RPE edema—so the best answer is ""Sometimes.""",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD distort vision by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD can cause choroidal neovascularization with leakage and hemorrhage that leads to retinal pigment epithelial scarring and fibrosis, producing distorted and reduced central vision; drusen or hypertension may influence risk or progression but RPE scarring and vision distortion can occur directly from the neovascular process and are not limited to cases with drusen or only when hypertension is present.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False

Does diabetes exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with hypertension d) Only with smoking,b) No,"No — there’s no evidence here that diabetes worsens AMD by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration; instead the data link hypertension and smoking as established modifiers of AMD and implicate RPE changes in disease progression, but diabetes-driven RPE lipid regeneration is not supported.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does smoking worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes. Smoking is linked to increased risk and progression of AMD and to advanced/late forms including geographic/retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, and this effect is seen independently rather than only in the presence of UV exposure or obesity (though obesity is a separate risk factor).",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with diabetes,a) Yes,Yes — excessive lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium is implicated in AMD pathogenesis and can promote progression from atrophic (dry) disease to neovascular (wet) AMD; smoking and diabetes are additional risk factors that can worsen progression but are not required for conversion.,A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Does family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only in women d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes—family history increases AMD risk, and AMD commonly features subretinal/retinal pigment epithelial lipid and oxidized‑lipid deposits, so familial susceptibility likely acts in part through processes leading to RPE lipid accumulation; this association is not limited to women or dependent solely on hypertension.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections effectively treat neovascular (wet) AMD by suppressing choroidal neovascularization, reducing fluid and improving vision and disease activity, but they do not reverse retinal pigment epithelial atrophy; they manage exudation and prevent further vision loss rather than regenerate lost RPE tissue.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does hypertension exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Yes — hypertension is associated with increased occurrence and progression of AMD and can alter choroidal circulation and increase retinal pigment epithelial volume, promoting RPE/retinal edema that can worsen AMD; this is not limited to cases with diabetes or smoking.",A,B,A,B,B,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by assessing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — the Amsler grid only detects subjective visual distortion and may flag functional changes in early AMD, but it does not visualize or measure retinal pigment epithelial swelling; definitive detection of wet (neovascular) AMD requires clinical examination and imaging (e.g., OCT/angiography) to identify RPE elevation, subretinal fluid, or choroidal neovascularization.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with light eyes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"No — the evidence does not support that UV exposure speeds AMD by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair. Different light types can have opposing effects: excessive or blue‑wavelength exposure promotes oxidative stress, RPE and photoreceptor damage and links to dry AMD, whereas intermittent UV exposure can actually improve certain high‑risk RPE cell phenotypes. RPE changes are implicated in AMD progression, and smoking is a clear independent aggravating risk factor; there’s no basis for a light‑eye–only effect.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"Partially — AREDS formulations (antioxidants and zinc) have been shown to slow progression and lower the risk of advanced vision loss in intermediate dry AMD, but they do not reliably reverse established retinal pigment epithelial lipid/drusen deposits; zinc may modulate RPE biology and oxidative damage, yet reversal of deposits is not supported.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Does obesity increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"No — obesity is clearly associated with higher risk and worsening of AMD through systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, microvascular aging and pathological retinal angiogenesis, but the available information does not support obesity specifically promoting retinal pigment epithelial edema as the mediating mechanism; RPE swelling/elevation is more directly linked to hypertension, neovascular AMD, or diabetic/vascular conditions.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"No — neovascular (wet) AMD can produce sudden vision loss, but this is typically from choroidal neovascularization with hemorrhage or exudation and RPE elevation, not from lipid-rich RPE deposits such as drusen, which are associated with chronic AMD progression rather than abrupt vision loss.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,True,False,False,False
Does diabetes heighten AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with obesity,b) No,"No — diabetes is linked to an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence does not support that it heightens AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair; RPE proliferation/changes are described as features of AMD itself, while smoking and obesity are separate risk or aggravating factors.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"Yes — optical coherence tomography can reveal sub‑RPE deposits (drusen) that reflect retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation and is routinely used to detect the drusen and associated fluid or neovascular changes that indicate neovascular (wet) AMD, though it infers lipid deposition via these structural signs rather than directly measuring biochemical lipid content.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,False,False,False,False
Does smoking worsen dry AMD by promoting retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"No — smoking is a clear risk factor that worsens AMD overall and contributes to RPE dysfunction, atrophy, and progression to advanced/late disease; it also increases the risk of neovascular (wet) AMD, which can lead to scarring, but smoking is not shown to directly cause retinal pigment epithelial scarring as the primary mechanism worsening pure dry (atrophic) AMD.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"Answer: c) Sometimes. Photodynamic therapy (including verteporfin and vascular‑targeted PDT) is an established treatment for neovascular/wet AMD and can reduce macular edema and improve vision in many cases, and in some patients it can lessen retinal pigment epithelial elevation/edema—however it does not universally reverse RPE edema and effectiveness depends on the lesion subtype and timing of treatment.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,True,False
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by eliminating retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"Partially — eating lots of leafy greens supplies carotenoids, antioxidants and vitamins that bolster macular pigment and reduce AMD risk and can slow disease progression, but it does not eliminate established retinal pigment epithelial atrophy; targeted nutritional supplements have shown additional benefit in slowing progression in some cases.",C,C,C,C,B,No Help,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Wet (neovascular) AMD can and does lead to legal blindness through neovascularization, exudation, RPE damage and photoreceptor loss, but the notion that it causes legal blindness by inducing ""retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair"" is not supported; lipid accumulation and RPE degeneration contribute to vision loss and legal blindness typically arise with advanced disease.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes.

Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,Yes. Accumulation of lipids in the retinal pigment epithelium and related drusen formation are implicated in progression from dry (atrophic) AMD to the exudative/wet form by promoting RPE dysfunction and neovascular/exudative changes; this progression is not strictly dependent on UV exposure and drusen are a common but not the only pathway.,A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does AMD impair color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only wet AMD,b) No,"No — AMD impairs color and central vision through degeneration or loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and associated retinal damage, not by causing RPE regeneration; the neovascular (wet) form in particular is linked to RPE damage and exudation that worsens visual outcomes.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with surgery,a) Yes,"Yes.

Does family history increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Family history does increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration, but it does not directly cause retinal pigment epithelial swelling; instead, genetic predisposition raises the likelihood of developing AMD, and in certain AMD subtypes (notably exudative/neovascular disease) retinal pigment epithelial elevation or swelling can occur as a manifestation of the disease.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD distort vision by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD often produces leaky abnormal vessels that lead to retinal and retinal pigment epithelial swelling or elevation, which distorts vision; this can occur as part of wet AMD itself and is not limited to cases only with drusen or only with hypertension, although those may be associated risk factors.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it avoids retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"c) Sometimes.

Does smoking worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"Smoking is clearly linked to greater risk and worse severity of AMD, and AMD is associated with lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, but there is no specific evidence here that smoking directly increases RPE lipid accumulation as the causal mechanism—so the best choice is b) No.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can OCT detect early dry AMD by identifying retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with fluid,a) Yes,"Yes — spectral-domain OCT can detect early dry AMD by visualizing drusen and sub‑retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits beneath the RPE, allowing diagnosis before late-stage changes or fluid accumulation.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections treat wet AMD by blocking abnormal blood vessel growth and reducing leakage and retinal fluid to improve vision, but they do not reverse retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation (drusen), which is a separate aspect of AMD pathology requiring different approaches.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,Answer: b) No. The provided evidence links smoking and hypertension to AMD and to retinal/RPE edema—hypertension is specifically associated with RPE volume changes and retinal edema—but there is no information here showing diabetes contributes to AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial edema.,B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can progress to geographic atrophy, which is characterized by loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors, but the available information links progression to RPE degeneration and atrophic changes rather than to retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can AMD increase fall risk by impairing retinal pigment epithelial lipid metabolism? a) Yes b) No c) Only with wet AMD d) Only with dry AMD,a) Yes,"Yes — impaired lipid handling in the retinal pigment epithelium can contribute to AMD development and progression, and AMD is linked to visual impairment, altered gait and higher fall risk, so RPE lipid dysfunction can increase fall risk through AMD rather than being restricted to only the wet or only the dry form.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"Solar/UV exposure can contribute to retinal damage and has been linked to age‑related ocular disease and early AMD, and smoking is an independent aggravating factor, but there is no support that UV accelerates AMD by inducing retinal pigment epithelium lipid repair (intermittent UV exposure may even improve certain high‑risk RPE cell phenotypes); therefore the claim is not supported—No (b).",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes — the neovascular (wet) form of AMD can cause rapid vision loss by choroidal neovascularization and leaky vessels that produce exudation and RPE elevation/edema, and this acute loss can occur independent of drusen or hypertension.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"No — while antioxidant-rich diets or supplements can help reduce the risk or slow progression of age-related macular degeneration, they are not shown to reverse retinal pigment epithelial edema, which is typically managed with targeted therapies such as anti‑VEGF agents.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes.

Does dry AMD affect color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — dry (atrophic) AMD is characterized by drusen and degeneration or loss of the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to central and color/visual deficits, rather than by a process of retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"No — obesity is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence does not support that this occurs by promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair; obesity appears to contribute to AMD through inflammation, oxidative stress and altered lipid metabolism and can raise risk independently of diabetes.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD impair reading by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD often produces RPE elevation/swelling and exudation that disrupts the macula, causing central vision loss and blurred vision that impairs tasks like reading; drusen and smoking can be related risk factors but are not required for RPE swelling to cause reading difficulty.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with hypertension d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"High cholesterol, particularly altered HDL levels, is associated with increased AMD risk, but the information provided does not support the specific mechanism that high cholesterol causes retinal pigment epithelium lipid regeneration to drive AMD; hypertension and diabetes are cited as independent risk or aggravating factors, not necessary co-requirements for a cholesterol-driven RPE lipid regeneration pathway. Answer: b) No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by reversing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"AREDS formulations (antioxidants with zinc) can slow progression of intermediate/advanced AMD—especially with zinc—but there is no evidence they reduce progression by reversing retinal pigment epithelial edema; edema in AMD is typically managed with anti‑VEGF treatments (e.g., ranibizumab), while AREDS acts via nutritional support and effects on RPE biology rather than resolving edema.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,a) Yes,"Answer: b) No. Wet (neovascular) AMD can produce blind spots, but these result from choroidal neovascularization, exudation, bleeding and RPE damage or loss rather than from inducing lipid (drusen) deposits, which are more characteristic of early/dry AMD and contribute to disease progression rather than being the primary mechanism of scotoma formation.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,True,False,False,False
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with UV exposure,b) No,"Yes.

Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Answer: Sometimes. Lipid-rich deposits beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (drusen) are a hallmark of dry AMD and can promote RPE dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress that in some patients trigger neovascular conversion to wet AMD; however progression is variable and influenced by multiple risk factors (including but not limited to obesity), so dry AMD does not always become wet AMD and it is not solely caused by obesity.",C,A,C,A,A,Negative,True,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"Anti-VEGF injections effectively treat the neovascular (wet) form of AMD by suppressing choroidal neovascularization, reducing retinal fluid and improving vision, but they do not clear or reduce retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits (drusen/oxidized lipids); those lipid accumulations are a separate, chronic feature not resolved by anti-VEGF therapy, and other modalities target neovascular lesions or RPE repair rather than lipid removal.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Can wet AMD affect face recognition by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD involves retinal pigment epithelium changes and sub‑RPE lipid accumulation (e.g., drusen), and advanced AMD is associated with impaired face recognition, so wet AMD can impair face recognition via RPE lipid accumulation.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,False,True,False,False
Does hypertension worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"Hypertension is clearly linked to worsening and earlier progression of AMD through vascular and choroidal changes, but there is no evidence here that it does so by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair; lipid/cholesterol and diabetes are implicated in AMD risk, yet a specific hypertension‑driven RPE lipid‑repair mechanism is not supported.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False

Does smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial oxidative damage? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes. Smoking is linked to increased risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration, oxidative injury to retinal pigment epithelial cells is a recognized driver of AMD, and smoking-related damage to the RPE and retina provides a plausible pathway by which smoking exacerbates AMD independent of UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive choroidal inflammation alone? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"No — while marked choroidal inflammation can promote angiogenesis and drive the choroidal neovascularization that defines conversion to wet AMD, inflammation alone is generally not sufficient; progression typically reflects a combination of pro‑angiogenic signaling, aging and other risk factors such as smoking, genetics and systemic disease rather than isolated inflammation.",B,A,B,A,B,Positive,True,True,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing susceptibility to retinal pigment epithelial degeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only in men d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes.

Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing choroidal neovascular growth? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"Intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are an effective treatment for wet (neovascular) AMD: they reduce fluid, shrink or regress choroidal neovascular membranes, and often improve or stabilize vision, but they do not reliably eliminate all established lesions or fully restore damaged tissue, typically require ongoing injections, and therefore can partially reverse CNV growth rather than provide a complete cure.",C,C,C,C,B,No Help,False,False,True,False
Does hypertension worsen AMD by causing choroidal vascular leakage? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Yes — hypertension is linked to AMD occurrence and progression and alters choroidal/choriocapillaris circulation and choroidopathy, promoting changes that favor neovascular (wet) AMD and its characteristic choroidal vascular leakage; this is not limited only to patients with diabetes or to smokers.",A,B,A,B,B,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by revealing retinal pigment epithelial detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No. The Amsler grid can reveal central visual distortion and help flag early or intermediate AMD, but it does not visualize structural lesions like retinal pigment epithelial detachments; RPE detachments—often seen in neovascular (wet) AMD—are diagnosed with imaging such as optical coherence tomography rather than by the grid.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by triggering choroidal neovascularization? a) Yes b) No c) Only with light eyes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"No — the evidence links light exposure (especially blue light) to retinal and RPE damage and to dry/early AMD, but it does not show that UV or general light exposure directly triggers choroidal neovascularization; smoking is clearly associated with increased risk and progression to neovascular AMD, while eye color is not indicated as a factor.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by repairing photoreceptor damage? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"No — AREDS-style antioxidant and zinc supplements can slow progression and reduce risk of worsening dry AMD, but they do not repair established photoreceptor damage; their benefit is protective against further degeneration rather than restoration of lost photoreceptors.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False

Does AMD impair depth perception by causing optic nerve damage? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only wet AMD,b) No,"No — age-related macular degeneration damages the macula and leads to central vision loss, blurred vision and reduced spatial/depth perception, but it is not shown to cause optic nerve damage; depth-perception problems result from macular/central-vision impairment in both dry and wet forms rather than direct optic nerve injury.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing choroidal neovascular leakage? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with surgery,a) Yes,"Yes — anti‑VEGF therapy given intravitreally reduces leakage from choroidal neovascular membranes, leading to decreased subretinal fluid, anatomical stabilization of wet AMD and improved visual outcomes, typically without the need for surgery; consistent, appropriately timed dosing is important for maintaining these benefits.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing choroidal thinning? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"No — a family history raises AMD risk and AMD is associated with choroidal thinning, but there’s no clear evidence that family history acts by directly causing choroidal thinning, so it’s a risk factor without proven mediation through choroidal thinning.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it lacks photoreceptor regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"c) Sometimes. Dry (atrophic) AMD usually progresses slowly and the limited ability of the adult retina to replace retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells contributes to that progressive loss, but the rate is also driven by other factors such as age, genetics, drusen and inflammation, and ongoing research (e.g., stem cell and tissue-engineering approaches) seeks to restore regeneration and alter disease course.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,True,False,False,False
Can hypertension exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Yes — hypertension can worsen AMD by promoting choroidal and microvascular changes (including increased RPE/Bruch's complex volume) that make retinal pigment epithelial detachments more likely and can accelerate AMD progression, and this effect is not limited only to patients with diabetes or obesity.",A,A,A,A,B,No Help,False,True,False,False
Does smoking worsen AMD by enhancing choroidal inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"Yes. Smoking promotes ocular and systemic inflammation, and inflammation—particularly in the choroid—drives worsening of AMD and choroidal neovascularization, so smoking can exacerbate AMD by enhancing choroidal inflammatory processes.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can OCT detect early dry AMD by identifying drusen size increases? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with fluid,a) Yes,"Yes — spectral-domain OCT can visualize and quantify drusen in early dry AMD, enabling detection of drusen size or volume increases and supporting diagnosis and monitoring before late-stage changes or fluid appear.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by regenerating retinal tissue? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"No — anti‑VEGF injections for wet (neovascular) AMD work by blocking abnormal blood‑vessel growth and reducing leakage and fluid to stabilize or improve vision and slow progression, but they do not regenerate lost retinal tissue; true tissue restoration is pursued with different strategies such as retinal pigment epithelium cell transplantation, stem‑cell approaches, or neurotrophic therapies.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by elevating retinal inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"The supplied information links retinal inflammation to age‑related macular degeneration and identifies smoking and hypertension as systemic contributors, but it contains no explicit connection between diabetes and elevated retinal inflammation leading to AMD; therefore, based on the provided data, the answer is No.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy by causing blood vessel leakage? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — dry (non‑neovascular) AMD progresses to geographic atrophy through degenerative loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, not by blood‑vessel leakage, which is a hallmark of neovascular (wet) AMD that can occur in later disease stages.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can AMD increase fall risk by reducing central visual clarity? a) Yes b) No c) Only with wet AMD d) Only with dry AMD,a) Yes,"Yes — age-related macular degeneration can increase fall risk by reducing central visual clarity; both wet and dry forms impair central vision and acuity, cause central vision loss and blurred vision, and are linked to gait and mobility changes that raise the likelihood of falls.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing immediate photoreceptor death? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"No. Although solar/UV exposure is linked to age-related ocular disease and may contribute to AMD risk over time, photoreceptor loss in AMD is a gradual, multifactorial process driven by RPE damage, drusen and inflammation rather than immediate UV-induced photoreceptor death; smoking can worsen AMD risk but does not make immediate UV photoreceptor killing the mechanism, nor is this effect limited to light-colored eyes.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes — the wet (neovascular) form of AMD can produce rapid, often irreversible central vision loss by growth of abnormal subretinal vessels that leak or bleed, causing submacular hemorrhage and subsequent scarring/fibrosis that damages photoreceptors and the RPE; drusen or hypertension may influence risk or progression but are not required for scarring and rapid vision loss to occur.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing Bruch’s membrane damage? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"Partially — diets rich in antioxidants (and antioxidant supplements) can help reduce the risk of AMD and slow its progression, but they are not shown to reverse established damage to Bruch’s membrane; the benefit is mainly preventive or disease-modifying rather than structural repair.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing VEGF levels? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes. Smoking is a well-established risk factor that worsens age-related macular degeneration and is linked to the neovascular (wet) form driven by VEGF; since VEGF mediates pathological choroidal neovascularization and anti-VEGF therapies target this pathway, smoking can exacerbate wet AMD through VEGF-related pro-angiogenic and inflammatory effects rather than only in the setting of UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD affect color perception by damaging retinal ganglion cells? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No. Dry AMD impairs color vision mainly by damaging the macula—photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium—causing central and color vision loss; it does not primarily damage retinal ganglion cells, which are more typically affected in conditions like glaucoma, although advanced or overlapping pathology can further worsen vision.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by sealing abnormal blood vessels? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with anti-VEGF,a) Yes,"Yes — photodynamic therapy can occlude abnormal choroidal blood vessels in wet AMD and has been used to seal neovascular lesions, though intravitreal anti‑VEGF agents are the current mainstay and PDT is typically reserved or used adjunctively for selected lesions or subtypes.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing retinal thinning? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"Answer: No. The evidence links obesity to higher risk and worsening of AMD through metabolic, inflammatory, vascular, and neurodegenerative mechanisms and shows retinal thinning as a feature of AMD, but there is no clear indication here that obesity directly causes retinal thinning as the pathway mediating its effect on AMD (though diabetes can also contribute to AMD risk).",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD impair reading by causing central vision distortion? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,Yes — wet AMD can cause central visual distortion and loss that interferes with reading; drusen and smoking can increase risk or worsen AMD but distortion and reading difficulty can occur with wet AMD itself and are not limited to cases with drusen or smoking.,A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol contribute to AMD by clogging retinal arteries? a) Yes b) No c) Only with hypertension d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"No — choice b. There’s no clear evidence that high cholesterol causes AMD by clogging retinal arteries; AMD mainly involves choroidal/macular circulation and complex metabolic and inflammatory processes. Some cholesterol markers (including HDL) have been associated with AMD risk, and systemic factors like hypertension and diabetes can influence AMD, but the effect is not a simple arterial clogging of retinal vessels.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by eliminating oxidative stress entirely? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"AREDS formulations containing antioxidants and zinc can reduce oxidative stress and slow progression of certain stages of AMD and improve outcomes, but they do not completely eliminate oxidative stress or fully halt disease progression; zinc contributes importantly to the protective effect but is not sufficient on its own to abolish oxidative damage.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by regenerating retinal tissue? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — wet (neovascular) AMD causes blind spots by abnormal blood vessel growth, leakage, and damage to the retinal tissue leading to central vision loss and scarring, rather than by regenerating retinal tissue; regenerative treatments are being researched but the condition itself is destructive.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to drusen accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes—hereditary factors and a positive family history increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration and are linked to greater drusen accumulation, so family history can predispose to AMD via drusen formation; this effect is not restricted to cases with smoking or UV exposure, although those exposures can also independently raise AMD risk.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive screen time alone? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"No — excessive screen time alone is not shown to cause dry AMD to progress to wet AMD; progression is linked to systemic and ocular risk factors such as obesity, inflammation, genetic and metabolic influences rather than screen use.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD by reducing fluid leakage? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"Yes — anti‑VEGF injections are an established treatment for wet (neovascular) AMD that reduce abnormal vessel leakage and retinal fluid, often improving retinal thickness and visual acuity; their benefit is not limited to only early stages nor dependent on photodynamic therapy.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does UV light increase AMD risk by causing optic nerve atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"UV radiation and bright light can contribute to retinal damage and age‑related macular degeneration, but the macular disease is a retinal/macula problem rather than a consequence of optic nerve atrophy; optic nerve atrophy causes visual loss by a different pathway and is not shown to be the mechanism by which UV increases AMD risk, so the answer is No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD affect face recognition by distorting central vision? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,Yes — wet (neovascular) AMD can distort and damage central vision and thereby impair face recognition; drusen and smoking can worsen risk or progression but are not required for central-vision–related face-recognition problems.,A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does hypertension worsen AMD by causing retinal hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"Yes — high blood pressure is linked to increased risk and progression of AMD and can cause retinal hemorrhages through hypertensive vascular damage, and since hemorrhages are a feature of neovascular/exudative AMD, hypertension can worsen AMD in part by promoting retinal bleeding; this is not limited only to people with diabetes or high cholesterol.",A,B,A,B,B,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal oxidative stress? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes—smoking raises retinal oxidative stress and is linked to higher risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration, and because oxidative stress is a key driver of AMD, smoking can exacerbate AMD via increased retinal oxidative stress rather than only with UV exposure or only with obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD cause vision loss by affecting the choroid directly? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Dry (atrophic) AMD leads to vision loss mainly through degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, while choroidal changes can occur and contribute to disease progression; direct choroidal involvement causing vision loss is typically a feature of more advanced or late-stage disease rather than an early primary cause.",D,B,D,B,B,Negative,True,False,False,False
Can OCT confirm wet AMD by visualizing choroidal neovascularization? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"Yes — optical coherence tomography, particularly OCT angiography, can visualize choroidal neovascularization and be used to confirm neovascular (wet) AMD; structural OCT can also detect quiescent or non‑exudative CNV, so detection is not limited to late stages or contingent on the presence of drusen.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,False,False,False,False
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal artery occlusion? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"No — while diabetes is linked to increased risk and progression of AMD via metabolic and microvascular retinal changes, the evidence does not indicate diabetes causes retinal artery occlusion; retinal artery occlusions are more directly associated with hypertension and other vascular factors.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — wet (neovascular) AMD can produce rapid or sudden vision changes by causing leakage and retinal edema; while drusen may be associated with AMD, edema from neovascularization can occur independent of drusen and is not dependent on UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing lipid deposits in the choroid? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Family history is a clear risk factor for AMD and AMD is characterized by lipid‑rich deposits in the RPE/choroid, but there’s no evidence here that familial risk specifically acts by increasing choroidal lipid deposits—so the answer is No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy prevent wet AMD progression by stabilizing retinal thickness? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"Yes — intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy is used to treat wet (neovascular) AMD and works by reducing intraretinal and subretinal fluid, stabilizing retinal thickness and thereby improving anatomic and visual outcomes; this effect can slow disease progression and help prevent vision loss and is not limited to only early stages nor does it require photodynamic therapy, though PDT can be used as an adjunct in certain cases.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does smoking increase dry AMD risk by causing choroidal thinning? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"Answer: b) No. Smoking is clearly linked to increased risk and progression of AMD and dry AMD is characterized by choroidal thinning, but the evidence here does not show smoking directly causes choroidal thinning or that its effect on dry AMD is mediated specifically by choroidal thinning (nor is it shown to be only with UV exposure or only with high cholesterol).",B,A,B,A,B,Positive,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD impair driving by distorting central visual acuity? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD directly disrupts central visual acuity—producing distortion, blurring or central vision loss—that can reduce driving performance and safety; smoking increases risk and can worsen AMD and drusen are commonly associated, but neither drusen nor smoking are required for wet AMD to impair central vision and driving.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol exacerbate AMD by causing optic nerve inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"No — altered cholesterol levels (including HDL) are linked to AMD risk, and diabetes and hypertension are independent risk factors that affect AMD and ocular vasculature, but there is no evidence here that high cholesterol worsens AMD by causing optic nerve inflammation.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by repairing retinal pigment epithelium? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"AREDS-type nutritional supplements, particularly antioxidant formulations that include zinc, can reduce the risk of progression in age-related macular degeneration and positively influence retinal pigment epithelium health, but they do not reverse or regenerate established RPE damage—so they can partially mitigate risk by protecting and supporting RPE function rather than repairing lost RPE.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by regenerating retinal layers? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — wet (neovascular) AMD impairs depth and spatial perception by damaging and distorting the retinal layers and central vision (leading to blurred vision, reading and mobility difficulties), not by regenerating retinal layers; regeneration is not a typical disease mechanism and is mainly a goal of experimental treatments rather than the cause of depth perception issues.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing retinal inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Obesity promotes systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and elevated inflammatory cytokines that extend to the retina; those retinal inflammatory processes drive and aggravate AMD, so excess weight can increase the risk and worsen AMD by boosting retinal inflammation.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to excessive neovascularization? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"Answer: No — dry AMD evolves into geographic atrophy through atrophic degeneration rather than excessive new blood‑vessel growth, which characterizes wet (neovascular) AMD.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False

Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by causing photoreceptor regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"No — UV and blue light are more consistently linked to oxidative stress, photoreceptor and retinal pigment epithelium damage that can worsen age‑related macular degeneration, rather than increasing AMD risk by triggering photoreceptor regeneration; occasional experimental reports of intermittent UV improving some cellular phenotypes exist, but overall light exposure promotes degeneration, and eye color alone is not the determining factor.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD can lead to chronic CNV leakage or hemorrhage that scars and damages the retinal pigment epithelium, causing central vision loss and retinal deafferentation, which in turn can produce visual hallucinations (Charles Bonnet–type); this is not limited only to cases with drusen or only to smokers.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Does hypertension contribute to AMD by increasing drusen size? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"Hypertension is linked to AMD and can worsen or promote progression, but the supplied evidence does not indicate that hypertension specifically increases drusen size; drusen size is tied to serum cholesterol instead, so the best answer is b) No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can smoking increase AMD severity by promoting photoreceptor degeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes.

Does dry AMD impair reading by causing optic nerve damage? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"b) No. Dry AMD impairs reading by damaging the macula and central vision—causing blurred or lost central vision and difficulty reading—rather than by injuring the optic nerve, which is typically affected by other diseases such as glaucoma and is not described as a consequence of dry AMD.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can OCT detect early AMD by measuring retinal layer thinning? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"Yes — spectral-domain OCT can detect early AMD by revealing thinning of the outer retina and photoreceptor/outer segment layers, showing abnormalities even in drusen-free areas and allowing diagnosis before late-stage changes.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does diabetes exacerbate AMD by causing direct blood vessel leakage? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"The evidence here does not support diabetes as a direct cause of blood-vessel leakage that exacerbates AMD; leaky vessels and exudation are features of neovascular AMD, but smoking and hypertension are the clearer, repeatedly indicated aggravators of AMD and microvascular damage, while diabetes is not shown as a direct driver of AMD-related vessel leakage.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD affect color perception by causing central vision loss? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes.

Does family history worsen AMD by causing optic nerve atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"No — a family history can increase or aggravate age‑related macular degeneration, but there’s no indication it does so by causing optic nerve atrophy; optic nerve atrophy is a separate condition (obesity can independently worsen AMD but doesn’t link family history to optic nerve atrophy).",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by preventing subretinal hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"Yes (a): intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are the standard treatment for neovascular (wet) AMD and choroidal neovascularization, reduce disease activity and fluid and improve vision, and by controlling the abnormal vessels that commonly cause subretinal/submacular hemorrhages they lower the risk of such bleeds (photodynamic therapy may be used in select cases as adjunct).",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does smoking worsen AMD by causing direct retinal detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"No — smoking clearly increases the risk of and worsens age-related macular degeneration, but it is not shown to cause direct retinal detachment; retinal detachment arises from other retinal pathologies or procedures, and smoking’s adverse effect on AMD is not dependent on UV exposure or high cholesterol to produce detachment.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD increase fall risk by impairing central depth perception? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD causes central vision loss and impairs central depth perception and spatial perception, leading to mobility problems and higher fall risk, and this can occur regardless of drusen or smoking.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing retinal vein occlusion? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"No. High cholesterol (notably HDL associations) is linked to AMD risk, but there’s no support for a pathway in which cholesterol causes retinal vein occlusion that then leads to AMD; retinal vein occlusion is more strongly tied to hypertension, while hypertension and diabetes independently affect AMD risk.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reducing retinal hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"c) Partially — AREDS/nutritional supplements (antioxidants and zinc) can slow progression of intermediate dry AMD and reduce risk of severe vision loss, but the evidence points to antioxidant and zinc-related protective effects rather than a clear mechanism of reducing retinal hypoxia.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Does wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by regenerating choroidal tissue? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — the wet (neovascular) form of AMD causes rapid or often irreversible central vision loss because abnormal growth of choroidal blood vessels, leakage and resulting damage to the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors drive the decline, not regeneration of choroidal tissue.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Can obesity increase AMD risk by enhancing choroidal oxidative stress? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes — obesity is associated with increased oxidative stress and adverse retinal/choroidal changes and is linked to higher risk and progression of AMD; because oxidative stress (including in the choroid and RPE) contributes to AMD pathogenesis, obesity can increase AMD risk by enhancing choroidal oxidative stress.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive antioxidant intake? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"No — excessive antioxidant intake is not shown to drive dry AMD into wet AMD; oxidative imbalances are implicated in AMD risk, but the neovascular (wet) form is characterized by excessive angiogenesis, and factors like obesity can worsen AMD and promote pathological angiogenesis without implying that antioxidant overconsumption alone causes conversion.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing retinal edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with anti-VEGF,a) Yes,"Yes — photodynamic therapy, especially verteporfin-based or vascular-targeted PDT, has been used to treat neovascular/wet AMD and associated macular/retinal edema and can reduce retinal edema; it is effective for certain lesion types (for example polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy) and is often used alone or together with anti-VEGF agents to improve anatomical and visual outcomes.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,False,False,True,False
Does UV light exposure worsen AMD by causing photoreceptor regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"No — UV/blue light exposure is linked to oxidative stress, RPE and photoreceptor damage and can aggravate or accelerate AMD, but it does not worsen AMD by causing photoreceptor regeneration; while some controlled intermittent UV exposures have been reported to improve cellular phenotypes in specific experimental settings, the dominant effect of excessive or blue/UV light is harmful, and there is no clear rule that only light-colored eyes are affected.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can wet AMD impair night vision by distorting central visual fields? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD damages the macula and commonly produces central visual distortion and progressive central vision loss, which can impair night-time tasks such as driving or reading; drusen and smoking are risk factors that influence AMD development and severity, but central field distortion and night-vision problems can occur with wet AMD itself and are not limited to cases only with drusen or only with smoking.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does hypertension increase AMD severity by causing optic nerve swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"No. While high blood pressure is linked to higher risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration through vascular and choroidal/RPE changes, there’s no indication that it increases AMD severity by causing optic nerve swelling; hypertensive effects on the optic nerve tend to involve ischemic or vascular events rather than a pathway of optic nerve swelling driving AMD.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing choroidal hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes.

Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing optic nerve inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with hypertension,b) No,"No — diabetes is linked to increased occurrence and progression of age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence points to retinal and choroidal vascular/degenerative mechanisms rather than diabetes causing inflammation of the optic nerve as the pathway.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD affect reading speed by causing central retinal blur? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD produces central retinal blur and central vision loss that commonly reduces reading speed and causes reading difficulty; this effect is not limited to cases with drusen nor solely due to UV exposure.,A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does family history worsen AMD by causing direct retinal scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"No — having a family history increases the risk of developing and worsening AMD but it does not directly cause retinal scarring; scarring arises from neovascular/exudative complications (leakage, hemorrhage and subsequent fibrosis) of advanced AMD, and factors like obesity can worsen AMD risk or progression, making scarring more likely indirectly.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing choroidal inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with photodynamic therapy,a) Yes,"No — anti‑VEGF injections improve wet AMD mainly by blocking abnormal blood-vessel growth and reducing leakage, yielding visual and anatomic benefits, but they are not primarily agents that reduce choroidal inflammation and can sometimes be associated with ocular inflammatory reactions; because inflammation can worsen neovascularization and influence treatment response, anti‑inflammatory or combination approaches (including photodynamic therapy in select cases) may be considered adjuncts.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,False,True,False
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing retinal regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,b) No,"No — smoking is clearly linked to higher risk and worse progression of age‑related macular degeneration, but there is no indication that it increases AMD risk by inducing retinal regeneration; retinal regeneration is associated with therapeutic approaches (e.g., stem‑cell or gene therapies), while UV exposure and high cholesterol are separate influences on AMD risk rather than evidence that smoking promotes regeneration.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does smoking increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Smoking clearly increases the risk and worsens age-related macular degeneration, and retinal hypoxia can drive RPE dysfunction and neovascular changes, with smoking also linked to RPE volume loss; however, the available information does not directly demonstrate that smoking increases AMD specifically by promoting retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia, nor is the effect restricted to cases with UV exposure or obesity.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial inflammation alone? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"No — while excessive retinal pigment epithelial inflammation can contribute to RPE damage and is linked with features seen in neovascular AMD, conversion from dry (atrophic) to wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD involves additional processes (neovascularization and other pathogenic drivers) and is not caused by RPE inflammation alone; factors like smoking and diabetes can increase the risk but are not the sole requirements for progression.",B,A,B,A,B,Positive,True,True,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing retinal pigment epithelial vulnerability to oxidative stress? a) Yes b) No c) Only in women d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"No — family history and oxidative stress are each tied to higher AMD risk and retinal pigment epithelial damage is a key mechanism, but the provided information does not show that family history specifically acts by increasing RPE vulnerability to oxidative stress; the association is not shown to be limited to women or only present with hypertension.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,b) No,"Anti‑VEGF injections are effective for treating the neovascular (wet) form of AMD by suppressing abnormal blood vessels, reducing fluid and hemorrhage, and improving or preserving vision, but they do not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial scarring or fibrosis; their main value in this regard is earlier treatment to limit or prevent scarring and worsening visual outcomes.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does hypertension worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Yes. Hypertension is linked to AMD occurrence and progression by impairing choroidal and retinal circulation, promoting microvascular aging and RPE changes that create hypoxic stress, which can drive RPE dysfunction and neovascularization and thereby worsen AMD.",A,B,A,B,B,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by measuring retinal pigment epithelial lipid changes? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — the Amsler grid is a subjective test for visual distortion and can flag functional changes from macular disease, but it cannot measure retinal pigment epithelial lipid changes and therefore cannot reliably detect or diagnose wet (neovascular) AMD; clinical examination and imaging are required.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages? a) Yes b) No c) Only with light eyes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"Answer: No. Light exposure, especially blue wavelengths, can harm retinal pigment epithelium and promote AMD through oxidative stress and cell damage, and smoking worsens AMD risk, but the information provided ties retinal hemorrhages to neovascular/exudative disease and vascular causes rather than to direct UV-induced RPE hemorrhages, and there is no indication this is specific to light-colored eyes or only occurs with smoking.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does obesity heighten AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes. Obesity is linked to increased AMD risk and to altered lipid metabolism, retinal and retinal pigment epithelial dysfunction, and proinflammatory/oxidative changes; because AMD involves lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, obesity’s effects on lipid metabolites and the retina plausibly promote RPE lipid build‑up and raise AMD risk, independent of diabetes or hypertension.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Diabetes is linked with a higher risk of age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence points to vascular, metabolic and inflammatory effects on the retina (including macular edema and choroidal blood‑flow changes) rather than retinal pigment epithelial swelling as the primary mechanism; smoking and obesity are independent risk aggravators, so the best answer is No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does smoking worsen dry AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"Yes — smoking is linked to increased risk and progression of dry AMD and promotes retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and loss that favor accumulation and oxidation of sub‑RPE lipid deposits, worsening the disease rather than only acting via UV exposure or only when cholesterol is high.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial damage? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only early stages,b) No,"Photodynamic therapy is used to treat neovascular (wet) AMD by targeting abnormal choroidal vessels, reducing exudation and hemorrhage and often improving or stabilizing vision, but it does not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial loss; at best it can help control disease activity and limit further RPE damage and is most useful in selected subtypes or earlier stages as part of a combined or adjunctive approach.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,True,False
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by eliminating retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"Partially — leafy greens provide carotenoids, vitamins and antioxidants that support macular pigment and are linked to lower risk and slower AMD progression, but they do not eliminate retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia, so diet can help reduce progression but not fully reverse hypoxia; supplements or other targeted treatments may offer additional benefit in some cases.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"High cholesterol (including altered HDL levels) is linked to AMD risk, but the information provided does not support that it increases that risk specifically by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema; RPE/retinal edema is associated with AMD and with vascular leakage, while smoking and diabetes are clearer aggravating risk factors—so the best choice is b) No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — dry AMD can progress to wet (neovascular) AMD. Lipid-rich deposits beneath the retinal pigment epithelium, including drusen and oxidized lipid deposits, are linked to worsening disease and increased risk of transition to sight‑threatening neovascular AMD; drusen are a common manifestation of these deposits but progression is not solely dependent on drusen and does not require UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does AMD impair color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only wet AMD,b) No,"No — the information links AMD to retinal pigment epithelium damage or loss (particularly in neovascular/wet forms) and to central and overall visual impairment, but it does not support the claim that AMD causes retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair that specifically impairs color perception.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only early stages d) Only with surgery,a) Yes,"No — anti‑VEGF therapy stabilizes wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD by blocking abnormal vessel growth and reducing fluid to improve anatomy and vision, but it is not described as reducing lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, which is linked to AMD pathogenesis and addressed by other therapeutic strategies.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Can wet AMD distort vision by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD commonly produces exudation and elevation/swelling of the retinal pigment epithelium (e.g., RPE elevation/serous PED), which can distort central vision; this can occur as part of wet AMD itself and is not limited only to cases with drusen or only to those with hypertension, though drusen and systemic vascular factors may be associated.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can hypertension exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Hypertension is consistently linked with higher risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration and affects choroidal blood flow and the retinal pigment epithelium, but there is no support here that hypertension exacerbates AMD by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair; diabetes and obesity can also worsen AMD but do not make hypertension’s effect depend solely on RPE lipid repair. Therefore the best answer is: b) No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with light eyes,b) No,"No — the information links UV/solar radiation to ocular damage and to early AMD risk but does not support UV-driven retinal pigment epithelial swelling as the mechanism accelerating AMD; some evidence even shows intermittent UV exposure can improve certain high‑risk RPE cell phenotypes. Smoking is a well‑established independent accelerator of AMD, and eye color is not implicated as a necessary factor.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with supplements,b) No,"No — antioxidant-rich diets and antioxidant or nutritional supplements can reduce AMD risk, slow progression, and help prevent oxidative damage, but they do not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial atrophy; atrophic changes are not undone by diet alone, though supplements may help limit further progression.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial edema? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with obesity,a) Yes,"Yes — smoking is a well-established risk factor that aggravates neovascular (wet) AMD, and because wet AMD is associated with retinal and retinal pigment epithelial edema/elevation, smoking can worsen wet AMD and thereby contribute to increased RPE/retinal edema; this is not limited to UV exposure or obesity.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD affect color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"No — dry (atrophic) AMD is characterized by degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium, which impairs central vision and color perception; spontaneous RPE repair is not a feature of the disease, and any restoration of RPE is achieved through therapeutic interventions rather than by the disease itself.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"No — obesity is linked to a higher risk and worse progression of age-related macular degeneration, and AMD involves changes in the retinal pigment epithelium, but there is no evidence here that obesity increases AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; diabetes can also influence AMD risk but it does not change that conclusion.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does high cholesterol contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Only with hypertension d) Only with diabetes,b) No,"The data associate higher HDL/cholesterol levels with altered AMD risk and show AMD involves RPE degeneration or altered RPE proliferation, but there is no support that high cholesterol contributes to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair—so the answer is No (b).",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial repair? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Sometimes.

Does smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid peroxidation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"Yes. Smoking is linked to higher risk and worsened progression of AMD, AMD features lipid peroxidation in the retinal pigment epithelium that contributes to retinal degeneration, and together this supports that smoking exacerbates AMD at least in part by promoting RPE lipid peroxidation rather than only via UV exposure or high cholesterol.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with diabetes,a) Yes,Yes — excessive hypoxia of the retinal pigment epithelium can trigger abnormal blood-vessel growth and increased microvascular permeability that drive conversion of atrophic (dry) AMD into neovascular (wet) AMD; smoking and diabetes can increase the likelihood of progression but are not required for conversion.,A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,True,False,False
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing retinal pigment epithelial susceptibility to lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only in men d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"No — while family history and genetic factors clearly raise AMD risk and lipid-rich deposits and RPE dysfunction are central to disease, the available evidence does not indicate that family history specifically increases RPE susceptibility to lipid deposition, nor that the familial effect is limited to men or only occurs with hypertension.",B,A,B,A,A,Negative,False,True,False,False
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial inflammation? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only early stages,a) Yes,"Anti‑VEGF injections are an established treatment for wet AMD that block abnormal vessel growth and reduce fluid, improving vision; they do not primarily act as anti‑inflammatory agents against retinal pigment epithelial inflammation, though by controlling neovascular activity and exudation they can indirectly and partially reduce RPE‑associated inflammation—so the effect on RPE inflammation is partial rather than a direct anti‑inflammatory cure.",C,C,C,C,A,No Help,False,False,True,False
Does hypertension worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,b) No,"No. Hypertension is associated with higher risk and progression of AMD and can affect choroidal and RPE structure, and AMD is linked to retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation, but the available evidence does not show that hypertension directly causes RPE lipid deposition—hypertension likely worsens AMD via vascular and choroidal mechanisms rather than by directly inducing RPE lipid accumulation.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by identifying retinal pigment epithelial detachment? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,b) No,"The Amsler grid can reveal central distortion and flag possible wet AMD symptoms, but it does not identify retinal pigment epithelial detachments; those structural lesions are detected with retinal imaging such as optical coherence tomography rather than by the Amsler grid, so the correct answer is No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial oxidative stress? a) Yes b) No c) Only with light eyes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"Yes. Short-wavelength light exposure (especially blue/UV) can drive oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelial cells, promoting cellular dysfunction and death that contributes to AMD progression; this is a general effect not restricted to light-colored eyes and not contingent on smoking, although smoking independently increases oxidative stress and further raises AMD risk.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,False,True,False,False
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid peroxidation? a) Yes b) No c) Partially d) Only with zinc,b) No,"AREDS-type supplements can partially slow progression of dry AMD, likely by reducing oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation in the retinal pigment epithelium; zinc in the formulation appears to be an important contributor to that protective effect, but the benefit is risk reduction and slowing of progression rather than a cure.",C,B,C,B,B,Negative,False,False,False,False
Does obesity increase AMD risk by enhancing retinal pigment epithelial oxidative damage? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with hypertension,a) Yes,"Yes — obesity is linked to higher risk of age-related macular degeneration and is associated with systemic oxidative stress and inflammatory changes; since oxidative damage to retinal pigment epithelial cells is a recognized causal pathway for AMD, obesity likely contributes to AMD at least in part by promoting RPE oxidative injury.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — neovascular (wet) AMD can lead to retinal pigment epithelial scarring: abnormal choroidal neovascular membranes leak and bleed, causing RPE damage and subretinal fibrosis, and acute events such as submacular hemorrhage or rapid exudation can produce sudden, often severe central vision loss; this is not limited to cases with drusen or to UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does diabetes heighten AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid peroxidation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with smoking d) Only with obesity,b) No,"Diabetes is associated with increased AMD risk and AMD shows retinal pigment epithelial lipid peroxidation, but the available evidence does not demonstrate that diabetes specifically causes RPE lipid peroxidation as the mediating mechanism; other factors like smoking and obesity are documented AMD aggravators, so the best answer is b) No.",B,B,B,B,B,Neutral,False,True,False,False
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits? a) Yes b) No c) Only late stages d) Only with drusen,a) Yes,"No — while OCT readily visualizes sub‑RPE lipid deposits such as drusen, which indicate AMD and risk of progression, the diagnosis of wet (neovascular) AMD requires evidence of choroidal neovascularization or active exudation/retinal fluid; OCT (and OCT‑angiography) can detect those neovascular and fluid signs, but detecting RPE lipid deposits alone does not establish wet AMD.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,False,False
Does smoking worsen dry AMD by accelerating retinal pigment epithelial degeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Only with UV exposure d) Only with high cholesterol,a) Yes,"Yes.

Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by causing retinal pigment epithelial degeneration? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only late stages,a) Yes,"Yes — wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD can cause degeneration or loss of the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to severe central vision loss and potentially legal blindness, most commonly when the disease is advanced or when neovascular complications rapidly damage the macula.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid peroxidation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with diabetes d) Only with smoking,a) Yes,"No. The information links lipid peroxidation to AMD and links certain cholesterol measures (notably higher HDL) to increased AMD risk, but it does not show high cholesterol directly promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid peroxidation as the causal mechanism; smoking and diabetes emerge separately as established aggravating risk factors.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,True,False,False
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial lipid peroxidation? a) Yes b) No c) Only with drusen d) Only with UV exposure,a) Yes,"Yes — excessive lipid peroxidation in the retinal pigment epithelium is implicated in AMD, promoting RPE cell death and retinal degeneration that can drive progression from dry (non‑neovascular) AMD to the neovascular (wet) form; drusen and other risk factors can further raise that risk, but oxidative lipid damage itself can contribute to the transition.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
Does AMD impair color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only wet AMD,a) Yes,"Sometimes. AMD damages the retinal pigment epithelium and causes central visual impairment; hypoxia-driven changes that promote neovascular (wet) AMD can lead to RPE dysfunction and vascular leakage that impair color perception, while RPE degeneration in atrophic (dry) AMD can also disrupt photoreceptor support and affect color vision, so hypoxia is more typical of wet AMD but RPE loss from either form can reduce color perception.",C,A,C,A,A,Negative,False,False,False,False

Which reading aid helps AMD patients? a) Large-print books b) Ear plugs c) Walking sticks d) Compression socks,a) Large-print books,"Age-related macular degeneration often causes central vision loss and difficulty reading, and low-vision reading aids—such as magnifying devices and enlarged print—improve reading ability and critical print size, so large-print books are a helpful reading aid for AMD patients.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
What causes macular swelling in wet AMD? a) Macular edema b) Macular atrophy c) Macular hole d) Macular pucker,a) Macular edema,"In wet AMD the swelling of the macula is caused by macular edema from leaky choroidal neovascular vessels (VEGF-driven), leading to intraretinal and subretinal fluid accumulation—so the correct answer is (a) macular edema.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,True,False,False,False
What benefit comes from regular eye exams for AMD? a) Early detection b) Complete cure c) Vision restoration d) Disease reversal,a) Early detection,"Regular eye exams enable early detection of age-related macular degeneration by diagnosing the disease in its early stages, allowing timely monitoring and treatment to help preserve vision even though they do not provide a complete cure or reversal.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
What condition involves pigment clumping in dry AMD? a) Retinal pigment epithelium clumping b) Choroidal atrophy c) Photoreceptor loss d) Macular edema,a) Retinal pigment epithelium clumping,"Pigment clumping in dry AMD reflects clumping of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), a characteristic RPE change often seen with drusen and geographic atrophy, rather than choroidal atrophy, photoreceptor loss, or macular edema.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
Which technology assists AMD patients with reading? a) Screen readers b) Pacemakers c) Insulin pumps d) Hearing aids,a) Screen readers,"Age-related macular degeneration commonly causes difficulty reading due to central vision loss, and assistive technologies for the visually impaired—most directly screen readers—help restore reading ability by converting text to speech; pacemakers and insulin pumps are unrelated to reading, and hearing aids address hearing rather than reading.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
What condition tears the retina in severe AMD? a) Retinal tear b) Retinal detachment c) Retinal schisis d) Retinal hole,a) Retinal tear,"Severe AMD can lead to various macular complications, but actual breaks in the neurosensory retina are typically retinal tears—often caused by posterior vitreous detachment—which can progress to retinal detachment and require urgent surgical management; therefore the correct choice is retinal tear.",A,B,A,B,A,Positive,False,False,False,False
How does exercise benefit AMD patients? a) Improves retinal blood flow b) Increases drusen c) Worsens vision d) Raises UV exposure,a) Improves retinal blood flow,"Regular physical exercise supports retinal health in age-related macular degeneration by improving retinal and choroidal circulation, helping modulate abnormal vessel growth and enhancing response to therapies, and is not linked to increased drusen, worsened vision, or higher UV exposure.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
What condition puckers the macula in AMD? a) Macular pucker b) Macular edema c) Macular hole d) Macular fibrosis,a) Macular pucker,"In age-related macular degeneration, especially the neovascular form, subretinal scarring and macular fibrosis produce contractile scar tissue that puckers and distorts the macula, so macular fibrosis is the condition that puckers the macula.",D,A,D,A,A,Negative,False,False,False,False
Which future tool might diagnose AMD? a) Artificial intelligence b) Blood pressure monitor c) Pulse oximeter d) EEG,a) Artificial intelligence,"Artificial intelligence—particularly automated deep‑learning diagnostic tools applied to retinal imaging and related tests—is the most likely future tool to diagnose age-related macular degeneration; blood-pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, and EEGs are not supported as diagnostic tools for AMD.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
What condition dilates retinal blood vessels in AMD? a) Retinal vascular dilation b) Choroidal neovascularization c) Retinal hemorrhage d) Macular edema,a) Retinal vascular dilation,"In age-related macular degeneration, the neovascular (wet/exudative) form—marked by choroidal neovascularization and related entities such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy—produces invading new vessels and focal vascular dilation, so choroidal neovascularization is the condition that dilates retinal blood vessels.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,False,False
Which cooking aid helps AMD patients? a) High-contrast cutting boards b) Noise-canceling headphones c) Orthopedic shoes d) Glucose monitors,a) High-contrast cutting boards,"High-contrast cutting boards are helpful for people with age-related macular degeneration because the condition reduces central vision and contrast sensitivity, making food items and knife edges harder to see; the strong color/contrast differences improve visibility and safety during cooking.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
What disrupts photoreceptors in AMD? a) Photoreceptor disarray b) Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy c) Choroidal atrophy d) Macular edema,a) Photoreceptor disarray,"In AMD, atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium is the main driver of photoreceptor disruption; choroidal atrophy can contribute by impairing choroidal blood supply and secondarily damaging the RPE and outer retina, while macular edema is a secondary finding in some forms and ""photoreceptor disarray"" is not identified as the primary cause.",B,B,B,B,A,No Help,False,False,False,False
How does quitting smoking help AMD? a) Reduces oxidative stress b) Increases drusen c) Raises blood pressure d) Worsens vision,a) Reduces oxidative stress,"Quitting smoking reduces oxidative stress and the oxidative damage that contributes to AMD, lowering the risk and progression to late disease and helping preserve vision; it does not increase drusen, raise blood pressure, or worsen vision.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,True,False,False
What condition leaks blood into the retina in wet AMD? a) Retinal hemorrhage b) Macular edema c) Choroidal rupture d) Vitreous detachment,a) Retinal hemorrhage,"In wet AMD, abnormal choroidal neovascularization produces leaky blood vessels that bleed into the retina, causing a retinal (macular) hemorrhage—so choice a) is correct.",A,A,A,A,A,Neutral,False,False,False,False
