Does smoking increase the risk of wet AMD by promoting abnormal blood vessel growth?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to a higher risk of late, neovascular (wet) AMD and is associated with the abnormal growth of retinal/choroidal blood vessels; it appears to promote microvascular aging and inflammatory processes that favor progression to the exudative, neovascular form of AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD because of oxidative stress alone?,False,"Oxidative stress is a major contributor to AMD pathogenesis and progression—damaging retinal pigment epithelium and mitochondria, promoting cell death and inflammation, and influencing processes linked to neovascularization—so it can drive changes associated with conversion to wet AMD; however, progression to the neovascular form is multifactorial, and oxidative stress alone is unlikely to be sufficient in most cases without genetic, inflammatory, complement and vascular contributors.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does a family history of AMD increase the likelihood of wet AMD due to genetic predisposition to VEGF overexpression?,True,"A family history of AMD reflects inherited genetic risk that increases the chance of developing AMD and thus raises the likelihood of progressing to the neovascular (wet) form, since vascular endothelial growth factor is a key driver of wet AMD and genetic variants can increase AMD susceptibility; however, the provided information links family history and genetic predisposition to higher AMD risk generally but does not specifically show that inherited changes directly cause VEGF overexpression as the mechanism for developing wet AMD.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by completely eliminating drusen deposits?,False,"Anti‑VEGF injections are effective for treating wet (neovascular) AMD by reducing abnormal blood vessels, fluid, and vision loss, but they do not typically remove or completely eliminate drusen deposits, which are features of the non‑neovascular (dry) form and are not the primary target of anti‑VEGF therapy.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does high blood pressure contribute to AMD risk by directly causing retinal detachment?,False,"No — the links point to high blood pressure increasing AMD risk mainly through vascular mechanisms such as reduced choroidal blood flow and disturbed vascular homeostasis, not by directly causing retinal detachment. Retinal detachment is generally a separate condition with other causes, and while AMD and detachment can co-occur, the evidence here does not support hypertension causing AMD via retinal detachment; controlling blood pressure may still help reduce retinal disease risk.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD symptoms because it measures peripheral vision loss?,False,"No. The Amsler grid is used to detect central visual distortions (metamorphopsia) from macular disease and to monitor early AMD, particularly the central vision loss caused by wet AMD; it does not measure peripheral visual field loss, and wet AMD typically affects central rather than peripheral vision, so the grid won't detect peripheral-vision deficits.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by accelerating choroidal neovascularization?,False,"Light exposure—particularly blue light—has been linked to retinal and RPE damage, oxidative stress, cell death and dry AMD, and choroidal neovascularization is clearly implicated in neovascular (wet) AMD and vision loss; however, the available information does not support a direct causal role for UV exposure in accelerating choroidal neovascularization to increase AMD risk, and intermittent UV exposure has even been reported to improve some RPE cell phenotypes, so a specific UV→CNV→AMD pathway is not established.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD progression by repairing the Bruch’s membrane?,False,"AREDS and related nutritional supplements can slow progression of dry AMD—particularly in intermediate stages—and reduce the risk of advanced vision loss, but there is no indication that they repair or restore Bruch’s membrane, which is a structural contributor to AMD pathophysiology and likely requires other targeted interventions.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does obesity heighten AMD risk by increasing oxidative damage to the retina?,True,"Yes. Obesity is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory markers, oxidative damage occurs in the retina and is implicated in AMD pathogenesis, and obesity is linked to higher risk and worse progression of AMD, so obesity likely heightens AMD risk at least partly by promoting retinal oxidative damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss due to the rupture of drusen deposits?,False,"Wet (neovascular) AMD can cause sudden vision loss, but this is usually due to bleeding or rapid fluid leakage from abnormal new blood vessels beneath the retina rather than simple rupture of drusen; occasionally a drusenoid pigment epithelial detachment can collapse or rupture and cause abrupt visual change, and submacular hemorrhage from neovascular membranes is a common cause of acute severe vision loss, so any sudden decline needs urgent evaluation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by directly causing abnormal blood vessel growth?,False,"Diabetes is associated with an increased occurrence and progression of age-related macular degeneration, but the link is not principally that diabetes directly induces the abnormal choroidal neovascularization that characterizes neovascular AMD; diabetes more clearly drives retinal neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy and alters choroidal blood flow and vascular structure, so vascular, metabolic and inflammatory changes from diabetes may contribute to AMD risk rather than a straightforward, direct cause of the abnormal blood-vessel growth seen in neovascular AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can optical coherence tomography diagnose wet AMD by detecting fluid leakage under the retina?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography visualizes retinal layers and reliably shows intra‑ and subretinal fluid and macular fluid associated with neovascular (wet) age‑related macular degeneration, so it is routinely used to diagnose and monitor wet AMD; OCT angiography can further reveal abnormal blood vessels causing leakage, while dye angiography may be used adjunctively to confirm active leakage when needed.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking exacerbate dry AMD by accelerating geographic atrophy progression?,True,"Yes. Evidence indicates smoking increases the risk and severity of AMD, promotes progression to late/dry forms, and is associated with faster development and enlargement of geographic atrophy; current smoking links to earlier progression, while smoking cessation is associated with reduced risk of geographic atrophy.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing oxidative stress in the retina?,False,"Oxidative stress in the retina contributes to onset and progression of AMD, and interventions that reduce oxidative stress can help treat the disease; therapies can treat wet (neovascular) AMD, but the information provided does not indicate that photodynamic therapy specifically works by lowering retinal oxidative stress, so one cannot conclude from these data that photodynamic therapy treats wet AMD via oxidative-stress reduction.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does a diet rich in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by eliminating existing drusen?,False,"Eating plenty of leafy greens (rich in lutein/zeaxanthin and other antioxidants) is associated with lower AMD risk and can help slow progression by increasing macular pigment and improving nutritional status, but it does not eliminate existing drusen; drusen are deposits that drive progression to advanced disease, and diet or supplements may reduce progression risk but do not clear established drusen or reverse existing atrophy.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness because it affects peripheral vision?,False,"Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration can lead to legal blindness, but that outcome is driven by loss or distortion of central vision from macular damage rather than loss of peripheral vision; peripheral fields are generally spared in AMD, so peripheral-vision loss and resulting legal blindness are more typical of other eye diseases such as glaucoma or retinal dystrophies.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing lipid deposits in the cornea?,False,"High cholesterol is linked to increased AMD risk and AMD is characterized by lipid‑rich and oxidized lipid deposits beneath and within the retina (drusen and subretinal drusenoid deposits), but the cornea is not the site of these disease‑related deposits; there’s no indication that cholesterol causes corneal lipid deposits that lead to AMD, so any cholesterol‑related risk likely acts through retinal lipid accumulation and related processes rather than the cornea.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to excessive VEGF production in the retina?,True,"Yes. Dry AMD can progress to neovascular (wet) AMD when excessive retinal production of vascular endothelial growth factor stimulates pathological angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization, causing exudation and rapid central vision loss; this VEGF‑driven conversion underlies the use of intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapies to control neovascular growth and limit vision damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD impair color perception by directly damaging the optic nerve?,False,"No — AMD primarily damages the macula and retinal tissue, producing central vision loss and impaired color perception; it does not directly injure the optic nerve, which is affected by other conditions such as glaucoma or optic neuritis.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by preventing further photoreceptor loss?,True,"Anti-VEGF injections are the standard treatment for wet AMD and reduce abnormal vessel growth, fluid and exudation, often improving anatomical measures and vision and thereby stabilizing the disease and reducing the risk of further photoreceptor loss in many patients. Responses vary, however—some eyes show partial or no response and efficacy can wane over time—so anti-VEGF does not universally prevent ongoing photoreceptor degeneration, and long-term preservation may require close monitoring and additional or alternative neuroprotective or restorative strategies.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does a family history of AMD increase risk by altering retinal blood flow?,False,"Family history and inherited genetic variants clearly raise the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, and altered retinal blood flow is also implicated in AMD, but the available information does not show that a family history increases risk specifically by changing retinal blood flow; genetic factors are the documented familial pathway while blood‑flow changes are a separate contributor to disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause wavy lines in vision due to fluid buildup under the macula?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration causes abnormal leaking vessels and fluid to collect under or within the macula, and that subretinal/intraretinal fluid and exudation can swell and distort the macula, producing blurred or wavy (distorted) central vision; imaging can detect the fluid, and prompt treatment with intravitreal anti-VEGF injections often reduces fluid and can improve or stabilize vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it lacks choroidal neovascularization?,True,"Yes. Dry (non‑neovascular) AMD generally progresses more slowly because it lacks the abnormal choroidal blood‑vessel growth and leakage that characterize wet (neovascular) AMD; those new vessels and associated exudation drive faster and often more severe vision loss, whereas dry AMD causes gradual atrophy and progressive central vision decline over time. However, dry AMD still leads to progressive vision loss and some eyes can harbor quiescent or nonexudative neovascular changes that may alter its course.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can high blood pressure worsen AMD by increasing intraocular pressure?,False,"High blood pressure can worsen age-related macular degeneration mainly by impairing ocular blood flow and disturbing vascular homeostasis, and controlling hypertension may help protect the retina; the information provided does not show a direct link from systemic hypertension to increased intraocular pressure—elevated intraocular pressure in these records is associated with ocular disease and local treatments (for example neovascular AMD and intravitreal injections/implants) rather than with high systemic blood pressure.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing direct damage to the lens?,False,"Smoking clearly increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration and worsens its course, but this effect is not explained mainly by direct injury to the lens; smoking also causes cataracts and other lens changes, yet AMD is a retinal/macular disease and the smoking–AMD link is attributed to other damaging processes rather than lens damage alone.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT detect early AMD by identifying changes in retinal thickness?,True,"Yes. OCT, particularly spectral-domain and volumetric OCT, can quantify retinal thickness and reveal outer retinal and outer-segment thinning and other subtle retinal abnormalities associated with early AMD, making it a useful tool for detecting early disease-related changes that can correlate with visual function.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by reducing drusen size?,False,"No — anti‑VEGF injections improve outcomes in wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD by suppressing abnormal neovascular growth and reducing fluid/exudation to preserve or improve vision; they are not described as reducing drusen size, which are deposits associated more with non‑neovascular stages and whose size predicts progression rather than being the direct target of anti‑VEGF therapy.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can diabetes contribute to AMD progression by elevating retinal inflammation?,True,"The evidence provided makes clear that retinal inflammation both accompanies and drives age-related macular degeneration and that various systemic and local insults can aggravate retinal inflammation and thereby worsen AMD progression. Therefore, if diabetes raises retinal inflammatory activity, it could plausibly contribute to AMD progression; however, a direct link between diabetes and elevated retinal inflammation is not specified in the supplied information, so that specific connection cannot be confirmed here.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD lead to geographic atrophy by causing blood vessel leakage?,False,"No — geographic atrophy in the dry (non‑neovascular) form of age‑related macular degeneration arises from progressive loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, not from blood vessel leakage; vascular leakage and exudation are features of neovascular (wet) AMD, whereas dry AMD leads to atrophy through degenerative processes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase fall risk in older adults by impairing depth perception?,True,"Yes—AMD commonly causes central vision loss and broader visual impairment in older adults, leading to reduced spatial and depth perception, altered gait and mobility, and thereby increasing the risk of falls.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by directly causing photoreceptor death?,False,"Available evidence links UV exposure to ocular disease and visual impairment and may be associated with earlier AMD, but it does not support a clear, direct role for UV in killing photoreceptors to accelerate AMD; photoreceptor loss in AMD is principally driven by disease processes such as RPE degeneration, drusen accumulation, inflammation and vascular changes, so UV may be a contributing risk factor without proven direct photoreceptor cytotoxicity in AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss due to subretinal hemorrhages?,True,"Yes. The wet (neovascular/exudative) form of age-related macular degeneration can produce abnormal blood vessels under the retina that bleed, causing subretinal or submacular hemorrhages that often produce sudden, severe central vision loss and can be irreversible; prompt ophthalmic evaluation and treatment (for example with anti-VEGF therapy) can help limit damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by repairing retinal pigment epithelium?,False,"A diet rich in antioxidants is linked to reduced AMD risk and improved disease outcomes, largely because antioxidants reduce oxidative stress and help protect retinal pigment epithelium cells from apoptosis, but the evidence supports prevention and preservation rather than clear restoration or repair of already damaged RPE, so antioxidant-rich diets can help prevent or slow AMD but are not shown to regenerate lost RPE.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking worsen wet AMD by increasing VEGF levels in the retina?,True,"Smoking is a recognized risk factor that aggravates age-related macular degeneration and is associated with worse neovascular (wet) AMD; because wet AMD is driven by VEGF-mediated abnormal blood vessel growth and smoking can worsen disease and reduce the effectiveness of anti-VEGF therapy, smoking can plausibly contribute to VEGF-driven progression of wet AMD and poorer outcomes, so cessation is advisable.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD affect central vision because it damages the optic disc?,False,"No — dry (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration impairs central vision by damaging the macula and its retinal layers (including RPE and photoreceptors, as in geographic atrophy), not by injuring the optic disc, which is linked to other optic nerve disorders.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by sealing leaking blood vessels?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy—notably verteporfin-based and vascular-targeted PDT—can treat neovascular (wet) AMD by selectively occluding abnormal choroidal neovascular membranes and reducing leakage, which can stabilize or improve vision in some patients and is useful for certain subtypes such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; however, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are the primary treatment for stopping vessel leakage and PDT is typically used as an adjunct or alternative in selected cases.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does obesity increase AMD risk by directly causing retinal detachment?,False,"Obesity is linked to a higher risk and greater severity of age-related macular degeneration, likely through metabolic, inflammatory and oxidative pathways, but there is no indication that this increased AMD risk is mediated by obesity directly causing retinal detachment; retinal detachment is a separate vitreoretinal condition with different causes that can independently worsen vision and sometimes coexist with or affect AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD distort vision by causing retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, abnormal new vessels and associated leakage can produce retinal pigment epithelial detachments, which commonly distort and reduce central vision and visual acuity; these detachments are detectable with OCT and are a target for treatments such as anti‑VEGF therapy that can influence the detachment and visual outcome.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high cholesterol contribute to AMD by clogging retinal arteries?,False,"High cholesterol and altered lipid metabolism are linked to increased risk of age-related macular degeneration, and the condition involves changes in the choroidal and retinal vasculature and lipid-rich deposits, but the evidence points to a complex lipid-related process rather than a simple mechanism of cholesterol clogging retinal arteries like typical atherosclerotic blockages.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by eliminating oxidative stress entirely?,False,"AREDS supplements, which contain antioxidant vitamins and carotenoids, can reduce the rate of AMD progression by lowering oxidative stress in the retina and supporting retinal health, but they do not completely eliminate oxidative stress or fully prevent disease progression. Oxidative damage in AMD arises from multiple sources and drives mitochondrial dysfunction, cell death, complement activation and other pathogenic processes, so supplementation can be beneficial—especially at certain stages or in specific patient groups—but is not curative and other genetic and pathological factors also determine outcomes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD lead to blind spots by causing photoreceptor regeneration?,False,"No — wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration causes abnormal blood vessel growth, leakage and photoreceptor degeneration that produces central blind spots and progressive, often irreversible vision loss; it does not induce photoreceptor regeneration. Experimental approaches such as stem cell and gene therapies seek to restore or regenerate retinal tissue, but regeneration is a therapeutic goal rather than a consequence of the disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing individuals to drusen accumulation?,True,"Yes. A family history of age-related macular degeneration is linked to higher risk and can predispose people to the hallmark drusen and subretinal deposits seen in AMD; inherited susceptibility, together with processes that promote toxic and lipid-rich accumulation and inflammation, increases the likelihood of deposit buildup and progression to disease.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD because of excessive screen time?,False,"Current evidence indicates that progression from dry to wet AMD is driven by abnormal growth of blood vessels, leakage and inflammation and is influenced by age, systemic and genetic factors, rather than by screen exposure; therefore reducing excessive screen time is not recognized as a specific way to prevent conversion, and regular eye monitoring and management of known risk factors are the appropriate steps.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD outcomes by reducing fluid leakage?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections for wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD reduce fluid leakage and the amount of intra‑retinal and subretinal fluid, leading to improved retinal anatomy and better visual acuity and functional outcomes. These benefits often require repeated dosing and can impose a substantial treatment burden and carry potential risks such as elevated intraocular pressure and other injection‑related complications.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV light increase AMD risk by causing direct optic nerve damage?,False,"UV exposure is implicated in age‑related ocular disease and visual impairment and may contribute to early AMD, but the evidence here does not support the idea that UV increases AMD risk by directly damaging the optic nerve. AMD is a macular/retinal disorder distinct from optic nerve injury; the links shown point to UV effects on the retina and ocular health and to vitamin D interactions, but not a direct UV→optic nerve damage→AMD pathway.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair reading ability by distorting central vision?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration damages and distorts central vision—causing blurring, dark or blank areas, and central vision loss—which commonly leads to difficulty or loss of reading ability.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high blood pressure exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal hemorrhages?,False,"Yes — high blood pressure can worsen age-related macular degeneration in part by increasing the risk of retinal hemorrhages. Elevated systolic pressure and hypertensive vascular changes promote retinal bleeding and blood‑flow disturbances (including reduced choroidal flow and disturbed vascular homeostasis), and neovascular/exudative forms of AMD already predispose to hemorrhage, so hypertension can amplify bleeding and disease severity; conversely, blood pressure control helps reduce retinal disease risk.",True,True,True,True,No Help
Can smoking contribute to AMD progression by enhancing retinal inflammation?,True,"Yes. Smoking is associated with increased risk and faster progression of AMD and also aggravates retinal and ocular inflammation; because inflammatory processes are central to AMD pathogenesis and drive neovascularization and degenerative change, smoking-driven inflammation can plausibly contribute to worsening and earlier progression of AMD, and smoking cessation can reduce that risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause vision loss by directly affecting the choroid?,False,"Dry AMD leads to central vision loss primarily through degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors (geographic atrophy); the choroid is involved as part of the RPE–choroid complex and shows changes with advancing disease, but choroidal alterations are generally secondary contributors to progression and severity rather than the direct, primary cause of vision loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT confirm wet AMD by visualizing choroidal neovascularization?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography, and especially OCT angiography, can visualize choroidal neovascularization and is used to diagnose and confirm the neovascular (wet) form of age‑related macular degeneration; structural OCT also detects CNV-related features, including quiescent/nonexudative lesions, and is routinely used for confirmation and monitoring.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking increase wet AMD risk by triggering excessive VEGF production?,True,"Smoking is consistently linked to higher risk and worse progression of age-related macular degeneration, including the neovascular (wet) form, and to poorer responses to anti-VEGF treatment; however, the provided information does not show a clear direct pathway in which smoking specifically triggers excessive VEGF production—harm appears mediated by microvascular aging, RPE damage, inflammation and other pathogenic changes that promote neovascularization.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD solely due to a lack of antioxidants?,False,"Antioxidants can help reduce oxidative stress, protect retinal pigment cells, and are linked to lower risk or slower worsening of AMD, and dietary antioxidants are used to support clinical management; however, progression from dry to wet AMD is driven by multiple factors (age, genetics, inflammation, vascular changes, etc.), so a deficiency of antioxidants alone is unlikely to be the sole cause of conversion to neovascular (wet) disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing susceptibility to retinal inflammation?,True,"Yes. Family history raises AMD risk largely through inherited genetic susceptibility—particularly variants that alter complement and innate immune regulation—which increases the propensity for retinal inflammation; retinal inflammation in turn is a key contributor to AMD onset and progression, so familial risk operates in part by enhancing inflammatory susceptibility in the retina.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by removing existing drusen deposits?,False,"No — anti-VEGF injections are effective for wet (neovascular) AMD because they suppress abnormal blood-vessel growth and reduce fluid, often stabilizing or improving vision, but they do not remove existing drusen deposits, which are characteristic of (dry) AMD and are not cleared by anti-VEGF therapy.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does high blood pressure worsen AMD by causing direct photoreceptor damage?,False,"The available evidence does not show high blood pressure directly injures photoreceptors; rather, hypertension can impair choroidal blood flow and disturb vascular homeostasis, which aggravates AMD and thereby contributes to photoreceptor damage, so high blood pressure likely worsens AMD indirectly through vascular mechanisms rather than by direct photoreceptor toxicity.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can the Amsler grid detect dry AMD progression by measuring optic nerve function?,False,"No — the Amsler grid assesses macular/central retinal function by detecting visual distortion and can help monitor central changes in dry AMD, but it does not measure optic nerve function; optic nerve assessment and progression require different tests (visual fields/perimetry, OCT and optic nerve imaging).",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does UV light exposure accelerate wet AMD by causing retinal hemorrhages?,False,"The available information does not support a direct link whereby UV light exposure accelerates wet AMD by causing retinal hemorrhages. Wet or neovascular AMD is itself associated with retinal hemorrhages, but light exposure in these data is mainly tied to retinal and RPE damage, oxidative stress and dry AMD–related changes (with some reports that intermittent UV exposure can even improve certain cellular phenotypes), rather than to causing the vascular hemorrhages that drive progression to wet AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow AMD progression by repairing choroidal blood vessels?,False,"AREDS formulations of vitamins and minerals can slow progression of age-related macular degeneration in specific intermediate-to-advanced stages and improve outcomes, but the evidence and therapeutic pathways point to nutritional modulation of disease rather than restoration of choroidal vasculature; repair or regeneration of choroidal blood vessels is targeted by vascular or anti‑angiogenic therapies, not by AREDS supplementation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does obesity increase AMD risk by promoting oxidative stress in the macula?,True,"Yes. Obesity is linked to higher risk and worse progression of AMD and is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammatory markers systemically and in the retina; because oxidative stress in the macula and retinal pigment epithelium is a key driver of AMD development and progression, obesity likely contributes to AMD at least in part by promoting oxidative injury in the macula.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by rupturing the Bruch’s membrane?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) AMD abnormal choroidal vessels can breach or disrupt Bruch’s membrane, leading to submacular hemorrhage or RPE tears that produce abrupt central vision loss, so sudden severe vision decline in wet AMD is a recognized consequence and warrants urgent evaluation.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes heighten AMD risk by directly causing drusen accumulation?,False,"Diabetes is linked to higher occurrence and progression of age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence here does not support that diabetes directly causes drusen accumulation; drusen formation is mainly driven by aging, lipid, complement and local retinal factors, and diabetes likely influences AMD risk indirectly through vascular and metabolic changes rather than by directly producing drusen.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by visualizing subretinal fluid accumulation?,True,"Yes — optical coherence tomography directly visualizes subretinal fluid and other retinal/macular changes characteristic of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, making it a primary imaging tool to detect, monitor disease activity, and guide treatment; OCT angiography can further identify choroidal neovascularization.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking exacerbate dry AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial damage?,True,"Yes. Smoking increases the risk and accelerates progression of dry AMD by promoting damage to the retinal pigment epithelium—reducing RPE volume and function, disrupting cellular homeostasis and junctions, and contributing to RPE atrophy—which in turn drives photoreceptor loss, worse visual outcomes and higher likelihood of late-stage disease including geographic atrophy; stopping smoking can reduce that risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by eliminating oxidative stress?,False,"Photodynamic therapy, including verteporfin and vascular-targeted approaches, is used to treat the neovascular (wet) form of age-related macular degeneration by targeting and closing abnormal choroidal vessels and can improve vision, but oxidative stress is a separate and important driver of AMD and its progression; PDT addresses the vascular lesion rather than eliminating the underlying oxidative damage, so managing wet AMD often requires complementary strategies that target oxidative stress in addition to vascular treatment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD risk by reversing retinal thinning?,False,"Eating plenty of leafy green vegetables is linked to a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration, likely because these foods supply carotenoids, vitamins, minerals and other antioxidants that enrich macular pigment and support retinal health; however, this dietary pattern is not shown to reverse established retinal thinning—rather, it may help protect against or slow progression of AMD and related visual decline.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by impairing peripheral vision?,False,"Wet (neovascular) AMD primarily damages the macula and central vision and can progress to legal blindness in advanced or neovascular cases, but it typically spares peripheral vision—so when wet AMD causes legal blindness it is through loss/distortion of central vision rather than impairment of the peripheral visual field.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by depositing lipids in the retina?,True,"Yes—elevated circulating lipids are linked to higher AMD risk and lipid accumulation in the retina is a key feature of the disease: lipids contribute to drusen and subretinal deposits, and oxidized or excess circulating lipids promote local tissue injury, inflammation, impaired autophagy and abnormal vessel growth. Thus the effect is not just passive clogging by cholesterol but a complex process in which lipid deposition, oxidation and inflammatory responses together increase AMD risk.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to excessive choroidal inflammation?,True,"Yes — dry AMD can progress to wet AMD, and excessive choroidal inflammation is a plausible driver of that switch. Inflammation in the retina and choroid can promote angiogenesis and choroidal neovascularization, producing the exudation and rapid vision loss that define the wet form; inflammation can also worsen disease activity and influence treatment response. That said, conversion is not inevitable for every patient, so monitoring and managing inflammation and neovascular risk are important to detect and treat wet AMD early.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does AMD impair depth perception by damaging the optic nerve?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages the macula and central vision, leading to central vision loss, blurred vision and poorer spatial perception and mobility; this central visual impairment can reduce depth perception, but AMD does not typically injure the optic nerve—optic nerve damage is more characteristic of conditions such as glaucoma or optic neuritis—so any loss of depth perception in AMD is due to macular/central vision loss rather than direct optic nerve damage.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing neovascular leakage?,True,"Yes — intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy reduces neovascular leakage in wet (neovascular) AMD, often decreasing subretinal/intraretinal fluid and producing anatomical stabilization with corresponding visual benefits; maintaining that control usually requires regular dosing or tailored regimens, and newer dual‑target approaches can further limit leakage. Some patients show partial response or gradual loss of efficacy and treatments carry potential adverse effects, so ongoing monitoring and individualized therapy are important.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing direct blood vessel growth?,False,"Family history does increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration and can make the exudative form that involves abnormal blood-vessel growth more likely, but it is a predisposing risk factor rather than the direct cause of new vessel formation; molecular drivers such as VEGF and specific genetic variants and pathways are what actually promote the blood-vessel growth.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD distort vision by causing subretinal fluid buildup?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular/exudative) age-related macular degeneration commonly causes subretinal fluid to accumulate beneath the retina, and that fluid can distort vision and reduce central visual acuity; it is detectable with OCT and is often treated with anti‑VEGF therapies that reduce fluid and can improve vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it avoids photoreceptor regeneration?,False,"No. Dry AMD (including geographic atrophy) is a progressive cause of central and irreversible vision loss driven by degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors; it does not progress slowly because it “avoids” photoreceptor regeneration, but rather because the retina has limited innate regenerative capacity. Ongoing research into RPE transplantation, stem‑cell and Müller glia–based approaches and growth‑factor therapies aims to restore or replace lost cells because lack of effective regeneration contributes to continued degeneration, not a protective slowing of disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can high blood pressure exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment detachment?,False,"Yes. High blood pressure can worsen age-related macular degeneration by impairing choroidal blood flow and disturbing vascular homeostasis, which can promote AMD progression and the development or enlargement of retinal pigment epithelial detachments—particularly in neovascular AMD—and thereby increase the risk of retinal detachment and vision loss; controlling blood pressure may help reduce these retinal complications.",True,True,True,True,No Help
Does smoking worsen AMD by enhancing retinal hypoxia?,True,"Yes. Smoking is a well-established risk factor that increases the likelihood and progression of AMD, and retinal hypoxia drives neovascularization, RPE degeneration, and cell loss that worsen AMD; because smoking promotes microvascular damage and vascular dysfunction that can increase retinal hypoxia, it likely contributes to AMD progression at least in part by enhancing retinal hypoxia and its downstream pathological effects.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can OCT detect early dry AMD by identifying drusen size changes?,True,"Yes. Spectral-domain OCT can visualize drusen and outer retinal/RPE changes in early dry AMD, and quantitative drusen size and volume measurements obtainable with OCT correlate with disease status and risk of progression, making OCT a useful tool to detect and monitor early drusen size changes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by regenerating photoreceptors?,False,"No — anti‑VEGF injections for wet AMD work by stopping abnormal blood-vessel growth and reducing leakage and fluid to stabilize or improve vision; they do not regenerate lost photoreceptors. Photoreceptor loss in AMD is tied to retinal pigment epithelium and subretinal pathology, and true restoration of photoreceptors would require cell- or growth‑factor–based replacement or regenerative approaches being investigated separately.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by increasing systemic inflammation?,True,"Yes. Systemic inflammation is implicated in the development and progression of AMD—elevated inflammatory markers are linked to AMD and to intermediate stages, and systemic inflammatory states can drive tissue damage—so conditions that raise systemic inflammation, such as diabetes, can plausibly increase AMD risk and worsen its course.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD lead to geographic atrophy by causing neovascularization?,False,"No — geographic atrophy is the advanced, non‑neovascular form of dry AMD and arises from the dry AMD disease process itself rather than by dry AMD first causing neovascularization; neovascular (wet) AMD is a distinct pathway involving macular neovascularization, and although subclinical or nonexudative neovascular lesions can interact with atrophy progression, dry AMD does not produce geographic atrophy by inducing neovascularization.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase fall risk by impairing central vision clarity?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) commonly impairs central vision—causing blurring and central vision loss—which leads to visual impairment, poor spatial perception and mobility, and difficulties with reading and driving; these deficits are associated with altered gait and greater dependency, and collectively increase the risk of falls.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by directly damaging the choroid?,False,"Evidence links solar/UV light to age‑related ocular disease and shows light can affect choroidal tissues, but AMD arises from complex interactions among the retinal pigment epithelium, choroid, oxidative stress and damaging molecules. Therefore UV exposure may contribute to AMD risk and harm choroidal/RPE structures indirectly, but the information provided does not clearly support a direct, sole effect of UV damaging the choroid that accelerates AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing subretinal scarring?,True,"Yes. The wet (neovascular) form of AMD produces abnormal choroidal blood vessels that leak or bleed beneath the retina, and this ongoing leakage and hemorrhage can produce subretinal/submacular scarring and fibrosis that rapidly damages overlying photoreceptors and leads to sudden, often irreversible central vision loss; prompt treatment, typically with anti‑VEGF therapy, can reduce leakage and lower the risk of scarring and severe vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing Bruch’s membrane damage?,False,"Antioxidant-rich diets are associated with reduced risk and slower progression of age-related macular degeneration, likely by lowering oxidative stress and supporting retinal pigment epithelium health, but current evidence does not support that such diets can reverse established structural damage to Bruch’s membrane; their benefit is primarily preventive or disease-modifying rather than restorative of existing membrane changes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking worsen wet AMD by promoting choroidal neovascularization?,True,"Yes. Smoking increases the risk and accelerates progression of age-related macular degeneration and is linked with the neovascular (wet) form driven by choroidal neovascularization, leading to worse vision outcomes and reduced responsiveness to anti-VEGF therapy; stopping smoking can reduce risk and improve disease prognosis.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD affect color perception by damaging retinal ganglion cells?,False,"Dry (atrophic) AMD mainly damages the macula—photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium—causing central vision loss and altered color perception; the provided information links AMD to retinal degeneration and visual impairment but does not show a direct causal pathway from dry AMD to retinal ganglion cell damage. Retinal ganglion cell loss in the data is tied to other processes (glaucoma, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, amyloid/tau), so color deficits in dry AMD are more plausibly due to macular/photoreceptor/RPE dysfunction than primary ganglion cell injury.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing blood vessel leakage?,True,"The provided information does not describe photodynamic therapy; it characterizes wet AMD by choroidal neovascularization and exudation and highlights intravitreal anti‑VEGF treatments (including loading‑dose regimens and specific agents) as therapies that address leakage and improve anatomical and visual outcomes. Therefore, based on these data, there is no evidence here to conclude that photodynamic therapy reduces blood‑vessel leakage in wet AMD.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing direct retinal thinning?,False,"Obesity is associated with a higher risk and worse progression of age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence does not support a direct causal pathway in which obesity simply thins the retina; rather, obesity seems to raise AMD risk through systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic and microvascular changes and neuronal injury that contribute to retinal damage and secondary thinning as AMD advances.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair reading by causing central vision distortion?,True,"Yes. Wet age-related macular degeneration commonly produces distortion and loss of central vision—blurred, warped, or missing central areas—which directly impairs reading and other tasks that rely on sharp central sight and can lead to progressive visual impairment or even legal blindness.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high cholesterol contribute to AMD by increasing drusen formation?,True,"Yes. Abnormal lipid and cholesterol handling is linked to AMD and to drusen: higher levels of certain lipoproteins are associated with increased AMD risk, and defects in retinal pigment epithelium lipid metabolism and in transport across the choriocapillaris–Bruch’s membrane–RPE complex promote drusen formation. Chronic inflammation and choriocapillaris flow deficits also favor drusen accumulation, so elevated cholesterol likely contributes to AMD by promoting drusen formation, although it acts within a multifactorial disease process.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by fully eliminating oxidative damage?,False,"AREDS supplements can help slow progression of intermediate and some advanced forms of AMD and improve outcomes by reducing oxidative damage, but they do not fully eliminate oxidative stress or completely prevent disease progression, since AMD is multifactorial and other pathways beyond oxidation also drive pathology.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by regenerating retinal tissue?,False,"No — wet AMD causes blind spots by abnormal new blood vessels under the macula that leak fluid and blood, leading to retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor damage, scarring, and central vision loss; it does not regenerate retinal tissue. Experimental regenerative therapies (stem cells, RPE transplants, organoids, growth factors) are being studied to restore tissue, but they are not the reason blind spots occur in wet AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to photoreceptor loss?,True,"Yes. A family history of AMD or inherited retinal disorders raises the likelihood of developing AMD, and AMD is closely associated with photoreceptor and photoreceptor-cell loss, so familial genetic predisposition can indirectly increase the risk of photoreceptor degeneration and consequent vision impairment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive UV light exposure alone?,False,"No — excessive UV or light exposure can damage photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium and may raise risk or worsen AMD, but progression from dry (atrophic) to wet (neovascular) AMD is not driven by UV exposure alone; the switch to neovascular disease reflects a complex mix of aging, genetic, inflammatory, and vascular factors, so light is a contributing factor rather than a sole cause.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD by reducing retinal swelling?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are the standard treatment for wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD: they reduce fluid and central retinal/foveal thickness associated with choroidal neovascularization, decrease retinal swelling and exudation, and commonly lead to improved visual acuity and functional/morphological outcomes. These benefits can limit progression to severe vision loss, but repeated injections carry treatment burden, cost, and potential ocular risks (including sustained intraocular pressure elevation and glaucoma risk), so patients require ongoing monitoring.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV light increase AMD risk by causing optic disc swelling?,False,"The information shows UV exposure is associated with age‑related eye disease and visual impairment and that AMD can involve the optic disc and retinal/RPE swelling, but there is no direct evidence here that UV increases AMD risk by causing optic disc swelling; UV may affect AMD risk through other mechanisms rather than via optic disc swelling.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect face recognition by distorting central vision?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (""wet"") age-related macular degeneration damages the central retina, causing loss and distortion of central vision, which can make tasks that depend on fine central detail—such as recognizing faces—more difficult.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high blood pressure worsen AMD by causing choroidal hemorrhages?,False,"High blood pressure is linked with age-related macular degeneration and can impair choroidal blood flow and vascular stability, while higher blood pressure is associated with retinal hemorrhages and neovascular AMD is prone to subretinal/submacular bleeding; together this suggests hypertension can worsen AMD and increase the risk of hemorrhagic complications, but the available information does not establish a clear, direct causal pathway showing that high blood pressure specifically causes choroidal hemorrhages.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal oxidative damage?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to increased risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration, and oxidative damage is a central mechanism in AMD that affects the retina, so smoking can plausibly exacerbate AMD by promoting retinal oxidative damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause gradual vision loss by affecting the optic nerve?,False,"No — dry age-related macular degeneration leads to gradual loss of central vision by damaging the macula, photoreceptors, and retinal pigment epithelium, causing progressive central visual impairment; it does not primarily affect the optic nerve, which is implicated in other conditions such as glaucoma.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT confirm wet AMD by detecting abnormal blood vessel growth?,True,"Yes. OCT—and especially OCT angiography—can visualize the abnormal choroidal or retinal neovascularization and associated exudation that define wet (neovascular) AMD, making it a primary tool to detect the abnormal blood vessel growth; findings are typically interpreted with clinical examination and, when needed, complementary imaging to confirm diagnosis and guide treatment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal artery occlusion?,False,"Diabetes is linked to increased risk and development of age-related macular degeneration and produces many retinal and choroidal vascular changes (including diabetic retinopathy and macular edema) that could promote AMD, but there is no evidence here that diabetes causes retinal artery occlusion as the specific mechanism mediating that increased AMD risk; vascular dysfunction rather than overt arterial occlusion is the more supported pathway.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal edema?,True,"Yes. Wet AMD involves abnormal, leaky blood vessels that produce retinal edema, which can rapidly worsen retinal function and lead to sudden or acute changes in vision (blurring, central vision loss); reducing the edema—commonly with anti‑VEGF treatments—can improve vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing lipid deposits in the cornea?,False,"A family history does increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration, but the lipid accumulations tied to AMD are subretinal/drusen deposits at the retinal pigment epithelium and outer retina rather than lipid buildup in the cornea, so increased corneal lipid deposits are not the implicated mechanism.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy prevent wet AMD progression by stabilizing retinal thickness?,True,"Yes—intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy for neovascular (wet) AMD typically reduces intraretinal and subretinal fluid and stabilizes retinal thickness, a change that is associated with improved visual acuity and better anatomic outcomes and can slow progression toward vision loss; however, individual responses vary (including partial or non‑responders and potential slow loss of efficacy), so ongoing retinal imaging, individualized dosing, and attention to adverse effects are needed.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking increase dry AMD risk by causing direct choroidal thinning?,False,"Smoking is clearly linked to higher risk and progression of age‑related macular degeneration, including late dry forms, but choroidal thinning is described as a feature of AMD rather than shown here to be directly produced by smoking; the evidence points to smoking promoting dry AMD through RPE damage, inflammation and microvascular aging rather than by a demonstrated direct effect of thinning the choroid.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair driving by distorting central visual acuity?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration commonly distorts and reduces central visual acuity, producing central vision loss and visual impairment that can make driving difficult and degrade driving performance and safety.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high cholesterol exacerbate AMD by causing optic nerve inflammation?,False,"The data here link cholesterol—especially altered high-density lipoprotein levels—to AMD risk, but they do not show that high cholesterol causes optic nerve inflammation or that optic nerve inflammation worsens AMD. AMD is described as a macular/retinal disease in these entries, while optic nerve inflammation appears as a separate concept, so the specific pathway cholesterol → optic nerve inflammation → exacerbated AMD is not supported by the provided information.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by repairing retinal pigment epithelium?,False,"AREDS-style vitamin and antioxidant supplements have been shown to reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD—particularly in people with intermediate disease—and can slow disease worsening, but they do not repair or regenerate damaged retinal pigment epithelium and cannot reverse existing RPE cell loss or geographic atrophy.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by regenerating retinal layers?,False,"Wet (neovascular) AMD disrupts and damages the outer retina and RPE through abnormal blood vessels and fluid, altering retinal layer structure and impairing central vision, contrast sensitivity and spatial perception, which can lead to depth perception problems; these deficits stem from structural disruption and vision loss rather than from any regenerative rebuilding of retinal layers, while regeneration or RPE resurfacing is considered a therapeutic strategy rather than the cause of the depth perception issues.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing retinal inflammation?,True,"Yes. Obesity promotes systemic and ocular inflammation and oxidative stress, raising inflammatory cytokines and neuroinflammation in the retina; that heightened retinal inflammation can aggravate age-related macular degeneration, increase risk of progression to late-stage disease, and worsen vision-related outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to excessive blood vessel growth?,False,"No — dry AMD (the non‑neovascular form) can progress to geographic atrophy, but geographic atrophy results from degeneration and loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells rather than from excessive blood‑vessel growth, which is characteristic of the neovascular (wet/exudative) form of AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by shrinking abnormal blood vessels?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy can target and close abnormal choroidal blood vessels that cause wet AMD, reducing leakage and vessel activity, but current standard care relies on intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections that directly inhibit abnormal vessel growth and are the primary treatment to improve vision; PDT may be considered in select cases or as an adjunct.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment regeneration?,False,"No—there’s no clear evidence that UV exposure raises AMD risk by inducing retinal pigment regeneration. Instead, blue/UV light is linked to harm in the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors through oxidative stress, inflammation, cell death, lipofuscin buildup and mitochondrial/ER dysfunction, which can contribute to dry AMD and early disease signs; while isolated reports suggest intermittent UV exposure may improve some high‑risk cell phenotypes, regeneration of retinal pigment is associated with targeted regenerative therapies rather than UV exposure.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by inducing retinal scarring?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD can produce repeated leakage and hemorrhage from abnormal vessels that lead to subretinal/submacular scarring and fibrosis, damaging the macula and causing central vision loss; that loss and resulting retinal deafferentation can trigger visual hallucinations (for example, Charles Bonnet syndrome), so wet AMD can indirectly cause hallucinations via scarring-related vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high blood pressure contribute to AMD by increasing drusen size?,False,"Hypertension is linked to AMD through vascular effects such as reduced choroidal blood flow and disturbed vascular homeostasis, and blood pressure control may help prevent retinal disease, but there is no direct evidence here that high blood pressure specifically increases drusen size; drusen size is independently associated with AMD progression, yet a direct hypertension–drusen size link is not shown.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking increase AMD severity by promoting photoreceptor degeneration?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to increased risk and progression of AMD—including more advanced and atrophic forms—and AMD itself leads to photoreceptor degeneration, so smoking can worsen AMD severity by promoting photoreceptor loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD impair reading by causing optic nerve damage?,False,"No — reading difficulty in dry age-related macular degeneration is driven by damage to the macula and central retina that causes central vision loss and related visual deficits, rather than by injury to the optic nerve; optic nerve damage is a separate condition and is not the primary cause of reading impairment in dry AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT detect early AMD by measuring retinal layer thinning?,True,"Yes. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography can reveal thinning of the outer retina—including photoreceptor layers and outer segments—even in drusen-free areas, allowing detection and diagnosis of early age-related macular degeneration and monitoring of retinal thinning in non‑exudative disease.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes exacerbate AMD by causing direct blood vessel leakage?,False,"The information provided does not show a direct link that diabetes specifically causes blood‑vessel leakage to worsen AMD. AMD involves retinal vascular disease, exudation and neovascular changes, and noncommunicable vascular conditions can affect vessel leakage, so diabetes could plausibly aggravate AMD via broader vascular dysfunction, but a specific causal role for diabetes-induced vessel leakage in AMD is not demonstrated here.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect color perception by causing central vision loss?,True,"Yes—wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration damages the macula and commonly causes loss of central vision, and that central vision loss can reduce visual function including color perception and other aspects of sight such as reading and recognizing faces.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing optic nerve atrophy?,False,"Family history is linked to a higher risk of age-related macular degeneration, but there is no indication that this increased risk operates by causing optic nerve atrophy; AMD primarily involves the macula and retina and leads to central vision loss, while optic nerve atrophy is a separate cause of visual impairment not shown to mediate the family-history effect on AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by preventing subretinal hemorrhages?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are the standard treatment for wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD: by suppressing choroidal neovascularization and disease activity they reduce fluid, preserve and improve vision, and lower the likelihood of subretinal/submacular hemorrhage from the underlying disease. However, injections carry small procedure‑related risks (including occasional bleeding and pressure changes), so therapy reduces but does not completely eliminate the chance of hemorrhage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking worsen AMD by causing direct retinal detachment?,False,"Smoking is clearly linked to increased risk, progression, and worse outcomes in age-related macular degeneration and to other ocular diseases and vision loss, but there is no evidence here that smoking directly causes retinal detachment; retinal detachment can arise from other causes and can interact with AMD, yet the worsening of AMD by smoking is not explained by a direct induction of retinal detachment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD increase fall risk by impairing central depth perception?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD damages the macula and causes central vision loss and broader visual impairment, leading to poor spatial perception, reduced motion sensitivity and difficulties with tasks like reading and driving; those central-vision deficits can compromise depth perception and mobility, increasing dependency and the risk of falls in affected older adults.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing retinal vein occlusion?,False,"No—there is no support here that high cholesterol increases AMD risk by causing retinal vein occlusion. The information links high-density lipoprotein levels directly with AMD risk and shows AMD can be associated with retinal vein occlusion, but it does not indicate that high cholesterol causes retinal vein occlusion as an intermediate mechanism.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reducing retinal hypoxia?,False,"AREDS-type supplements have evidence for slowing progression in intermediate and certain atrophic forms of AMD through antioxidant and nutritional effects, but there is no direct evidence that they reduce retinal hypoxia; any benefit for hypoxia would be indirect—via lowering oxidative stress and slowing disease processes that contribute to hypoxia—so the idea that AREDS slows dry AMD specifically by reducing retinal hypoxia remains unproven.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by regenerating choroidal tissue?,False,"No — wet (neovascular) AMD causes rapid, often central vision loss because abnormal new blood vessels grow from the choroid into the retina, leaking fluid and blood and damaging the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors; it is a pathologic neovascular process, not regeneration of choroidal tissue. Anti‑VEGF treatments can reduce leakage and help preserve or improve vision, but the disease itself results from destructive vessel growth and exudation rather than tissue regeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity increase AMD risk by enhancing retinal oxidative stress?,True,"Yes. Obesity is associated with systemic and retinal oxidative stress and inflammation, and oxidative stress is a key driver of retinal damage and age-related macular degeneration; thus obesity can increase the risk and worsen progression of AMD by enhancing retinal oxidative stress.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive antioxidant intake?,False,"No — the evidence points to wet AMD arising from abnormal blood-vessel growth driven by factors like VEGF rather than from taking too many antioxidants; while oxidative imbalance is implicated in AMD and antioxidants can be used to treat or modify disease symptoms, excessive antioxidant intake is not shown to convert dry AMD into the neovascular (wet) form, which is characterized by pathological angiogenesis.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing retinal edema?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy, including verteporfin and vascular-targeted approaches, is used to treat neovascular (wet) AMD and associated macular/retinal edema; it can reduce exudation, improve visual acuity, and is often used alone or alongside anti-VEGF treatments to help manage edema and vision loss.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does UV light exposure worsen AMD by causing photoreceptor regeneration?,False,"No. Ultraviolet/blue light exposure is linked to retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor damage—via oxidative stress, inflammation, mitochondrial and ER stress, lipofuscin buildup and impaired RPE function—which can aggravate or precipitate AMD and photoreceptor degeneration. Photoreceptor regeneration is not caused by UV exposure; regeneration is pursued separately through therapies such as stem cell and gene‑based approaches.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair night vision by distorting central visual fields?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) age‑related macular degeneration damages the macula and produces distortion or loss of central vision—blurred vision, central scotomas and metamorphopsia—that reduces central visual fields and can impair night vision and night‑time activities such as driving, reading, and mobility.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high blood pressure increase AMD severity by causing optic nerve swelling?,False,"High blood pressure is linked to age‑related macular degeneration and can worsen retinal health by reducing choroidal blood flow and disturbing vascular homeostasis, and blood pressure control can help prevent retinal disease; however, there is no evidence here that hypertension increases AMD severity by causing optic nerve swelling—optic nerve swelling relates to optic neuropathies and visual impairment but is not described as a mediator of AMD progression.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing choroidal inflammation?,True,"Yes. Smoking promotes ocular and choroidal inflammation and inflammatory/angiogenic processes that worsen age-related macular degeneration, increasing risk of progression to advanced and neovascular forms; thus smoking can exacerbate AMD via heightened choroidal inflammation, and cessation reduces that risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause blind spots by damaging the retinal vasculature?,False,"Dry (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration produces central blind spots and progressive central vision loss by damaging the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors (geographic atrophy), not primarily by injuring the retinal blood vessels; vascular damage and abnormal new vessels are characteristic of the neovascular (wet) form and are detectable with imaging such as OCTA.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by identifying retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography readily visualizes retinal pigment epithelial detachments and associated fluid and neovascular signs that commonly occur in neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, so OCT (and OCT angiography when available) is used clinically to detect these detachments and support the diagnosis and management of wet AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing optic nerve inflammation?,False,"The information indicates diabetes is associated with an increased risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration through effects on the retina, choroidal blood flow, vascular and metabolic pathways, and other diabetes-related retinal diseases, but there is no evidence here that diabetes raises AMD risk by causing inflammation of the optic nerve; optic nerve inflammation appears as a separate entity (linked to conditions like glaucoma or optic neuritis) rather than a demonstrated diabetes-driven mechanism for AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect reading speed by causing central vision blurring?,True,"Yes. Wet age-related macular degeneration often causes central vision blurring and loss, which directly impairs reading and typically reduces reading speed; low-vision strategies such as magnifying aids, eccentric viewing and targeted reading training or rehabilitation can help improve reading performance.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history worsen AMD by causing direct retinal scarring?,False,"Family history increases the risk and severity of age-related macular degeneration and can make the sight-threatening neovascular/exudative forms more likely; those neovascular processes, persistent leakage or hemorrhage, and subsequent fibrosis are what produce retinal or macular scarring. In short, family history worsens AMD by raising susceptibility to scar-causing complications, but it does not directly cause retinal scarring itself.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing choroidal neovascular activity?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF agents are the standard treatment for wet (neovascular) AMD: they suppress choroidal neovascular membrane activity, reduce subretinal fluid and exudation, and typically produce anatomical improvement and gains in visual acuity. Some patients have partial or waning responses and there are potential adverse events, but overall anti‑VEGF therapy markedly improves visual outcomes and lowers the risk of blindness from wet AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment regeneration?,False,"Smoking is a well-established risk factor that increases the likelihood and worsens the progression of age-related macular degeneration, including higher risk of late-stage disease, but there is no indication that this effect is mediated by promoting retinal pigment regeneration; instead, smoking is associated with harmful changes to the retinal pigment epithelium and other ocular damage, while retinal pigment regeneration is promoted by therapeutic approaches such as stem-cell and gene-based interventions rather than by smoking.",False,True,False,True,Positive
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing excessive retinal pigment epithelial damage?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to a higher risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration and is associated with damage to the retinal pigment epithelium—including reduced RPE volume and RPE loss seen in AMD—and because RPE dysfunction and loss are central to AMD development and vision loss, smoking likely increases AMD risk at least in part by causing excessive RPE damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to a lack of dietary zinc alone?,False,"Zinc appears to have a protective role in AMD—supplementation is associated with slower progression and reduced risk of advanced/neovascular disease, and low dietary zinc has been linked to features associated with wet AMD—yet progression from dry to wet AMD is multifactorial (age, genetics, inflammation and other factors), so a lack of dietary zinc alone is unlikely to be the sole cause of conversion, though addressing zinc deficiency may help lower risk as part of broader management.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to chronic retinal inflammation?,True,"Yes. Familial risk often reflects inherited genetic and immune factors that predispose the retina to persistent inflammation, and chronic retinal inflammation promotes retinal pigment epithelium and Bruch’s membrane dysfunction, photoreceptor loss and exudative changes that increase the likelihood of AMD; therefore a family history can raise AMD risk at least in part by favoring chronic retinal inflammatory processes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing retinal thinning?,False,"Anti‑VEGF injections are the standard, effective treatment for wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD: they reduce fluid, improve central retinal thickness measurements and visual acuity, and can alter RNFL/thickness metrics. However, those thickness changes usually reflect resolution of edema rather than regeneration of lost tissue, and anti‑VEGF therapy does not reliably reverse established retinal thinning or atrophy (such as that from non‑exudative AMD or geographic atrophy). In short, anti‑VEGF controls disease activity and preserves vision but generally does not restore previously lost retinal tissue.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does hypertension worsen AMD by directly causing optic nerve degeneration?,False,"Hypertension appears to worsen AMD mainly through microvascular and choroidal damage that promotes AMD occurrence, progression, and neovascular changes; there is no indication here that it does so by directly causing optic nerve degeneration—although hypertension can cause ischemic optic neuropathy and other optic nerve injury, those are separate conditions rather than the established pathway linking hypertension to AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by measuring changes in peripheral acuity?,False,"The Amsler grid is designed to reveal central visual distortions and metamorphopsia from macular damage and can help flag macular disease including wet AMD, but it does not measure peripheral acuity; therefore it cannot reliably detect wet AMD by assessing peripheral vision changes and formal clinical examination and imaging are needed for diagnosis.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by inducing immediate choroidal neovascularization?,False,"No. Light, especially short-wavelength/blue exposure, can damage the retinal pigment epithelium, increase oxidative stress and inflammation, and thereby contribute to AMD onset or progression, but the evidence here links light more to RPE/photoreceptor injury and dry-AMD features rather than to an immediate triggering of choroidal neovascularization; CNV is characteristic of neovascular (wet) AMD and appears as part of disease progression rather than being directly and instantly induced by UV exposure.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by regenerating photoreceptor cells?,False,"AREDS-style vitamin and nutritional supplements can modestly slow progression of intermediate and some forms of dry age‑related macular degeneration and reduce the risk of severe vision loss, but they do not regenerate lost photoreceptor cells; true photoreceptor replacement or regeneration is an experimental strategy (eg, stem‑cell or transplantation approaches), not an effect of AREDS supplements.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does obesity exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal oxidative stress?,True,"Yes. Obesity is linked to systemic and retinal oxidative stress and to higher risk and worse progression of age-related macular degeneration, while oxidative stress is a well-established driver and aggravator of AMD; together these findings indicate that obesity can exacerbate AMD at least in part by increasing retinal oxidative stress, a pathway that may be mitigated by antioxidant and omega‑3 interventions.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by triggering retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD often produces retinal pigment epithelial detachments, and these detachments—or complications arising from them such as vascularized or serosanguinous PEDs, RPE tears and associated submacular hemorrhage—can abruptly reduce vision. PEDs are known to worsen visual acuity and carry a poorer prognosis, so wet AMD can cause sudden vision loss through PED formation and its sequelae, warranting prompt evaluation and treatment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing direct retinal hemorrhages?,False,"Diabetes is associated with a higher occurrence and influence on age-related macular degeneration and alters retinal and choroidal blood vessels, but it does not appear to increase AMD risk by directly producing retinal hemorrhages; hemorrhages are typically a feature of diabetic retinopathy or of neovascular (exudative) AMD itself, so diabetes likely promotes AMD risk via vascular dysfunction and other systemic mechanisms rather than by causing hemorrhages that then lead to AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting abnormal choroidal blood vessels?,True,"Standard OCT readily detects the hallmarks of wet (neovascular) AMD such as macular fluid, retinal layer changes and signs of macular neovascularization and is widely used to diagnose and monitor disease activity, but direct visualization of abnormal choroidal blood vessels is best achieved with OCT angiography, which images retinal and choroidal blood flow and improves detection of choroidal neovascular membranes, including early or nonexudative lesions.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking worsen dry AMD by accelerating photoreceptor degeneration?,True,"Yes. Smoking increases the risk of developing and progressing dry age-related macular degeneration, is associated with retinal pigment epithelium damage and other harmful changes that promote photoreceptor degeneration, and thus accelerates vision‑threatening loss in dry AMD; quitting smoking is linked to reduced progression such as lower risk of geographic atrophy.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by eliminating retinal inflammation?,False,"Wet AMD is driven by abnormal neovascularization and is closely associated with retinal inflammation that contributes to disease progression and vision loss; current standard care focuses on anti‑VEGF injections to suppress neovascular activity and improve anatomy and vision. Photodynamic therapy primarily targets abnormal choroidal vessels rather than directly eliminating retinal inflammatory processes, and it is not regarded as a means to resolve retinal inflammation on its own—therefore PDT is not considered an effective standalone strategy for treating wet AMD by removing retinal inflammation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by repairing retinal pigment epithelium?,False,"A diet high in leafy greens is associated with a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration and can slow its progression by supplying antioxidants, vitamins, carotenoids and other nutrients that bolster macular pigment and retinal health; however, this nutritional benefit appears protective and disease-modifying rather than directly repairing already damaged retinal pigment epithelium.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by causing peripheral vision distortion?,False,"Wet (neovascular) age‑related macular degeneration can progress to legal blindness because it damages central vision—causing distortion and loss of acuity—but it generally spares peripheral vision, so legal blindness from wet AMD results from central vision loss rather than peripheral-vision distortion.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing lipid buildup in the Bruch’s membrane?,True,"Yes. Elevated cholesterol—including altered HDL levels—is linked with higher AMD risk, and lipids and cholesterol carriers accumulate in Bruch’s membrane and drusen, impairing RPE/Bruch function; these lipid deposits and related inflammation and dysregulation are implicated in the development and progression of AMD, so cholesterol likely contributes to risk at least in part by promoting lipid buildup in Bruch’s membrane.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to excessive retinal hypoxia?,True,"Yes. Excessive retinal hypoxia can drive progression of dry AMD into the wet (neovascular) form by inducing VEGF-driven pathological angiogenesis and abnormal, leaky vessel growth beneath the macula; hypoxia aggravates RPE and retinal degeneration, promotes microvascular hyperpermeability and exudation, and thus contributes to choroidal neovascularization and the vision‑threatening wet phase that is treated with anti‑VEGF therapies.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD impair color perception by causing choroidal thinning?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration is associated with choroidal thinning and with central and general vision loss, and choroidal thinning can lead to altered choroidal perfusion that might affect retinal function and thus color vision; however, the provided information does not explicitly establish that AMD-induced choroidal thinning directly causes impaired color perception, so the link remains plausible but unproven.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing subretinal fluid?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy targets the VEGF-driven fluid in neovascular (wet/exudative) AMD, commonly reducing subretinal fluid, producing anatomical stabilization and often improving visual acuity; however responses vary—some eyes show only partial or no response and long‑term outcomes and potential adverse effects should be considered.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing direct retinal detachment?,False,"Family history is linked to a higher risk of age-related macular degeneration, but there is no indication that this elevated risk works by causing retinal detachment; retinal detachment is a separate condition with other causes, while family history appears to influence AMD risk directly rather than via inducing a detachment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause wavy vision by inducing retinal edema?,True,"Yes. In wet (neovascular) AMD abnormal, leaky blood vessels in the macula lead to fluid and exudation that cause retinal edema and damage; that swelling and disruption of the macula commonly produce blurred and distorted central vision, including wavy vision, and can be detected with retinal imaging and treated (often with intravitreal anti‑VEGF) to reduce leakage and improve or stabilize vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it lacks retinal pigment regeneration?,False,"Not exactly—dry (atrophic) AMD often progresses more slowly than the neovascular form because it lacks the rapid vision loss caused by abnormal blood-vessel growth and exudation, but its slow course is not simply explained by the absence of retinal pigment regeneration. Progressive loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, drusen and inflammatory and age-related factors drive gradual atrophy, and because the eye has limited spontaneous RPE regeneration the damage accumulates rather than reverses. Experimental strategies such as RPE cell transplantation, stem-cell and tissue-engineering approaches, and growth-factor–based treatments aim to restore or replace RPE and photoreceptors to slow or prevent progression, but no definitive cure exists yet.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can hypertension exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal vein occlusion?,False,"Yes. High blood pressure promotes retinal vein occlusions and other retinal microvascular damage, and it is linked with age-related macular degeneration and progression of macular disease; by increasing the risk of retinal vein occlusion and aggravating microvascular aging, hypertension can therefore worsen AMD and its visual consequences.",True,True,True,True,No Help
Does smoking worsen AMD by promoting chronic choroidal inflammation?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to higher risk and worse severity of age-related macular degeneration and induces damage to the retinal pigment epithelium, microvasculature, and inflammatory mediators in the choroid; chronic choroidal inflammation and related tissue dysfunction are established drivers of AMD progression, so smoking likely worsens AMD at least in part by promoting persistent choroidal inflammation.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can OCT detect early dry AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial changes?,True,"Yes. Spectral-domain OCT can detect early dry AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial changes—showing drusen and drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments, focal RPE dysfunction and atrophy, pigment changes and outer retinal/outer-segment thinning (even in drusen-free areas)—findings that precede or accompany photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss, making OCT a useful tool for early diagnosis and monitoring.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by repairing the optic nerve?,False,"No — anti‑VEGF injections for wet AMD do not repair the optic nerve. They work by blocking factors that drive abnormal blood vessels and leakage beneath the retina, reducing fluid and lesion activity and thereby preserving or improving central vision. While they benefit retinal disease, they do not regenerate or fix the optic nerve and, with repeated use, can influence retinal nerve fiber thickness and raise eye pressure, which in some cases may harm the optic nerve rather than repair it.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by increasing retinal oxidative damage?,True,"Yes — diabetes is associated with retinal injury driven by increased oxidative damage, and retinal oxidative damage is a central mechanism in age-related macular degeneration and its progression; therefore diabetes could contribute to AMD by elevating retinal oxidative injury and promoting AMD-related retinal degeneration.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy by causing retinal hemorrhages?,False,"No. Dry (non‑neovascular) age-related macular degeneration typically progresses to geographic atrophy through gradual atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, causing central vision loss, whereas retinal hemorrhages are a feature of the neovascular/exudative form of AMD rather than the dry form.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase fall risk by reducing central visual sharpness?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly reduces central visual sharpness—causing central vision loss, blurred vision and impaired acuity—which undermines reading, driving, spatial perception and mobility, leads to gait changes and greater dependency, and is associated with an increased risk of falls.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing immediate photoreceptor loss?,False,"The available findings do not support the idea that UV exposure directly causes immediate photoreceptor loss that accelerates AMD. AMD is characterized by progressive photoreceptor degeneration and vision loss, and solar/total UV is associated with ocular disease, early AMD changes, and visual impairment, but a direct causal link to acute photoreceptor death is not shown and the effects of UV can be complex, with some exposure patterns even reported to influence cellular phenotypes positively.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing choroidal scarring?,True,"Yes. The wet (neovascular) form of AMD can produce rapid central vision loss because abnormal choroidal neovascularization often leaks or bleeds, leading to subretinal/submacular hemorrhage and subsequent macular scarring and fibrosis; damage to the overlying retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors from this process can be rapid and often irreversible, though prompt anti‑VEGF treatment can limit exudation and reduce the likelihood of permanent scarring.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing choroidal thinning?,False,"A diet rich in antioxidants is linked to lower risk and improved management of AMD, likely by reducing oxidative stress and supporting macular health, but choroidal thinning is a characteristic structural change of AMD and related conditions, and there is no clear evidence that antioxidants specifically reverse choroidal thinning as the mechanism for preventing AMD; antioxidants may help slow progression or reduce risk, but they should not be assumed to restore choroidal thickness.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing retinal fluid accumulation?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to higher risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration, including the neovascular (wet/exudative) form that is characterized by retinal and subretinal fluid accumulation, so smoking can exacerbate wet AMD and promote greater fluid-related retinal damage, poorer vision outcomes, and reduced treatment response.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD affect depth perception by causing retinal artery occlusion?,False,"Dry age-related macular degeneration mainly damages the macula, causing central vision loss and impaired spatial perception that can reduce depth perception, but it does not typically cause retinal artery occlusion; retinal artery occlusion is a separate retinal vascular event that may coexist with other vascular conditions but is not a usual consequence of dry AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing choroidal neovascular activity?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy—especially verteporfin-based and vascular-targeted PDT—can reduce choroidal neovascular activity and is used to treat the wet (neovascular) form of age-related macular degeneration and associated choroidal neovascularization, often stabilizing or improving vision in selected patients and serving alone or as part of combination strategies for certain lesion types such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; anti‑VEGF injections remain a primary therapy, with PDT used complementarily or when appropriate to decrease neovascular activity.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing direct photoreceptor regeneration?,False,"No — obesity is linked to a higher risk and worse progression of age‑related macular degeneration through mechanisms such as inflammation, oxidative stress, altered lipids, microvascular aging, pathological retinal angiogenesis and neuronal degeneration that impair retinal structure and function, rather than by inducing direct photoreceptor regeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair reading by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) age‑related macular degeneration often produces exudation and elevation or swelling of the retinal pigment epithelium and related retinal changes, which disrupt central and detailed vision and commonly cause blurred vision and difficulty reading.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high cholesterol contribute to AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,False,"Elevated cholesterol, particularly altered high-density lipoprotein levels, is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration, and retinal pigment epithelial detachment is a well-recognized manifestation of AMD (especially the neovascular type), but the provided information does not show a direct link that high cholesterol specifically causes or increases retinal pigment epithelial detachment; thus the data support cholesterol as an AMD risk factor but do not confirm the proposed mechanism via increased RPE detachment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by fully repairing retinal layers?,False,"AREDS-style supplements can slow progression and reduce risk in certain stages of age-related macular degeneration and may improve patient outcomes, but they do not fully repair or restore damaged retinal layers; while nutrition can influence disease course, structural changes and atrophy of retinal layers caused by AMD are not reversed by these supplements.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by causing retinal pigment regeneration?,False,"No — wet (neovascular) age‑related macular degeneration causes blind spots by abnormal new blood vessel growth, leakage and resulting damage to the retinal pigment layer and photoreceptors leading to central vision loss; retinal pigment regeneration is a therapeutic aim to repair that damage, not the cause of the blind spots.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal hypoxia?,True,"Family history is linked to higher AMD risk, and retinal hypoxia is implicated in causing and aggravating AMD, but there is no direct evidence here that familial predisposition acts by promoting retinal hypoxia; thus family history likely raises AMD risk through genetic or other pathways rather than a demonstrated effect of inducing retinal hypoxia.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive dietary fat intake alone?,False,"Excessive dietary fat or abdominal fat can influence the risk of age-related macular degeneration, but conversion of dry (atrophic) AMD into the neovascular (wet) form is not caused by dietary fat alone; wet AMD reflects new blood-vessel growth and leakage driven by multiple factors—age, genetics, inflammation and other systemic and ocular processes—so diet may modulate risk but is unlikely to be the sole determinant of progression.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD by preventing retinal scarring?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are the standard treatment for wet (neovascular) AMD: by suppressing abnormal choroidal neovascularization, reducing fluid and hemorrhage, and improving vision they lower disease activity and the risk of progressive vision loss, and thereby can reduce the likelihood and extent of subsequent macular scarring. However, they do not reliably prevent scarring in every case—established fibrosis is often irreversible and some patients still develop scarring despite treatment—and long‑term management may require ongoing injections with associated burdens and risks.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV light increase AMD risk by causing retinal ganglion cell loss?,False,"The information associates UV exposure with various ocular diseases and with earlier or increased risk of macular degeneration and visual impairment, but it does not show that UV directly causes retinal ganglion cell loss that in turn raises AMD risk; retinal ganglion cell loss and AMD are both noted, yet no direct UV→ganglion cell death→AMD pathway is supported.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect face recognition by causing subretinal hemorrhages?,True,"Yes—neovascular (wet/exudative) AMD can produce subretinal/submacular hemorrhages that damage the macula and lead to central vision loss, which in turn impairs tasks like face recognition, especially in advanced disease.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does hypertension worsen AMD by causing direct retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Hypertension is linked to and can worsen AMD through vascular mechanisms—microvascular aging, choriocapillaris impairment, and promotion of early and neovascular disease—yet there is no indication that hypertension directly induces retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; its effects are more consistent with vascular damage and RPE/BRB volume changes rather than triggering regenerative RPE proliferation, which is associated with AMD pathology or targeted reparative therapies.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial oxidative stress?,True,"Yes. Evidence links smoking to increased oxidative stress in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium, oxidative stress promotes RPE cell damage and mitochondrial dysfunction that drive AMD onset and progression, and smokers have higher risk of advanced or late AMD—so smoking can exacerbate AMD by increasing RPE oxidative stress.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause gradual vision loss by affecting the retinal vasculature?,False,"Yes. Dry AMD typically causes gradual central vision loss; vascular changes in the retina and choroid can contribute to disease progression, but the vision loss in dry AMD mainly results from degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors rather than from a primary retinal vascular disorder.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT confirm wet AMD by visualizing subretinal scarring?,True,"Yes. OCT is a key diagnostic test that can demonstrate subretinal scarring, associated fluid/exudation, and other features of neovascular (wet) AMD, so it can support and often confirm a diagnosis of wet AMD when interpreted alongside clinical findings and evidence of choroidal neovascularization.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial inflammation?,True,"Yes. Diabetes is consistently linked to higher AMD risk and can drive retinal and choroidal vascular and metabolic disturbances that promote accumulation of advanced glycation end products, cytokine and inflammasome activity, and other proinflammatory changes in the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to RPE dysfunction or loss that contributes to AMD; however, while these mechanisms make RPE inflammation a plausible mediator, definitive proof that diabetes increases AMD risk solely via RPE inflammation is still limited and more targeted studies are needed.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing photoreceptor swelling?,False,"Yes. Wet (exudative) AMD is associated with vision changes and involves photoreceptor pathology; fluid/exudation and events like submacular hemorrhage commonly produce rapid vision loss, and swelling processes affecting the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells can plausibly contribute to acute decline, though sudden drops are most often linked to exudation or hemorrhage rather than isolated photoreceptor swelling alone.",True,False,True,False,Negative
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing choroidal lipid deposits?,False,"Family history clearly raises the risk of developing AMD, and AMD—especially dry forms—is characterized by accumulation of lipid‑rich subretinal and sub‑RPE deposits that worsen disease, so familial risk likely contributes indirectly through mechanisms that include increased lipid deposition in the choroidal/subretinal region, although direct proof that family history specifically causes greater choroidal lipid buildup is not shown.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal hypoxia?,True,"Anti‑VEGF therapy can stabilize wet AMD by blocking VEGF-driven abnormal vessel growth and leakage, reducing subretinal fluid and improving anatomic and visual outcomes, but it does not appear to do so by reducing retinal hypoxia; in fact, VEGF blockade can worsen tissue hypoxia, so clinical stabilization is achieved by suppressing neovascular activity and edema rather than by correcting underlying hypoxic drive.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does smoking increase dry AMD risk by causing immediate retinal thinning?,False,"Smoking clearly increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration, including dry and late forms, and is linked to structural changes in the retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch’s complex; dry (non‑exudative) AMD and geographic atrophy are in turn associated with retinal thinning. However, the evidence does not indicate that smoking causes immediate retinal thinning—rather, smoking appears to promote AMD and progressive RPE/retinal atrophy over time.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair driving by reducing central contrast sensitivity?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD commonly causes central vision loss and reduced central contrast sensitivity, and these visual deficits are linked to poorer driving performance and safety, including difficulty with lane keeping, gap selection, traffic-light observation, and general driving tasks. When central contrast is reduced—especially in bilateral disease or when the better-seeing eye is affected—drivers are more likely to experience impaired driving ability and increased dependence or restrictions.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high cholesterol exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"The available evidence does not support the specific idea that high cholesterol worsens AMD by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration. Certain lipoprotein levels are linked to increased AMD risk, and AMD clearly alters RPE proliferation and involves RPE loss, but there is no direct indication here that cholesterol triggers RPE regeneration that then exacerbates disease; cholesterol-related effects on AMD are more plausibly mediated by lipid and protein changes and by RPE dysfunction or loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by reversing retinal edema?,False,"AREDS-style vitamin and mineral supplements can help reduce the risk of progression in certain stages of age-related macular degeneration and support overall retinal health, but they do not reverse retinal edema; fluid related to neovascular (wet) AMD is caused by leaky vessels and is treated with targeted therapies such as anti-VEGF agents rather than by AREDS supplements.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by causing choroidal regeneration?,False,"Wet (neovascular) AMD causes depth-perception and spatial-vision problems by producing choroidal neovascularization, exudation and macular damage that distort and destroy the photoreceptors and retinal architecture, leading to central vision loss, blurred vision and impaired stereopsis. It is not caused by ""choroidal regeneration""—regeneration is a therapeutic concept (stem-cell and gene approaches aim to restore tissue), whereas the disease itself involves pathological neovascular growth and retinal injury that reduce depth perception.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing choroidal oxidative stress?,True,"Yes — obesity is associated with systemic and ocular oxidative stress and inflammation and is linked to increased risk and worse progression of AMD, while oxidative stress is a key driver of retinal/RPE damage in AMD; together this makes obesity-driven increases in choroidal oxidative stress a plausible mechanism by which obesity can worsen AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to excessive retinal pigment regeneration?,False,"Dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can indeed progress to geographic atrophy, but this is characterized by degeneration and loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors rather than being driven by excessive retinal pigment regeneration; current research and treatments therefore aim to prevent degeneration and restore or replace lost tissue through regenerative approaches rather than curb over‑regeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,True,"The information provided shows that wet/neovascular AMD often involves retinal pigment epithelial detachment and that treatments can improve anatomical outcomes, with intravitreal anti‑VEGF agents such as ranibizumab and aflibercept specifically noted to affect and treat pigment epithelial detachment; photodynamic therapy is not explicitly linked to reducing retinal pigment epithelial detachment in the supplied data, so you cannot conclude from these sources that PDT reduces PED in wet AMD.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by causing immediate retinal scarring?,False,"UV/blue light can harm retinal cells and promote oxidative stress and cell loss that increase the long-term risk of AMD, but it does not typically produce immediate retinal scarring; scarring usually arises later from neovascular complications, chronic damage, or subretinal hemorrhage that lead to fibrotic changes rather than from an acute UV injury.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by inducing photoreceptor loss?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age‑related macular degeneration can destroy photoreceptors and produce central vision loss and retinal deafferentation; severe vision loss from this process is a known trigger for visual hallucinations such as Charles Bonnet syndrome, so photoreceptor loss from wet AMD can lead to hallucinations, especially with greater impairment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does hypertension contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"Hypertension is associated with increased risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration and with retinal and subretinal hemorrhages, so it can worsen or aggravate AMD, but the available information does not clearly establish that hypertension directly causes hemorrhages of the retinal pigment epithelium that then lead to AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking increase AMD severity by promoting retinal edema?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to greater risk and more severe, often neovascular, forms of age-related macular degeneration, which are associated with fluid accumulation in the retina; by promoting microvascular damage and neovascular changes and reducing treatment response, smoking can contribute to increased retinal edema and worse AMD outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD impair reading by causing retinal pigment regeneration?,False,"No — dry age‑related macular degeneration impairs reading because it causes progressive loss of central vision and degeneration of the macula, retinal pigment epithelium, and photoreceptors, not because of retinal pigment regeneration; regenerative approaches such as cell transplantation and stem‑cell or tissue‑engineering strategies are being explored to restore RPE and photoreceptors and potentially improve reading, but regeneration is a therapeutic goal rather than the cause of reading difficulty.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT detect early AMD by identifying changes in choroidal thickness?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography can measure and map choroidal thickness, and early (non‑exudative) age‑related macular degeneration is associated with detectable choroidal changes on OCT, so OCT‑based choroidal thickness assessment can help identify early AMD—though it is one of several imaging biomarkers and should be interpreted alongside other clinical and retinal findings.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes exacerbate AMD by causing immediate choroidal neovascularization?,False,"The provided information indicates that choroidal neovascularization is a feature of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration and is a major cause of vision loss, but it does not show that diabetes directly or immediately causes CNV in AMD; diabetes may be a comorbid retinal vascular condition that could influence disease course, yet there is no evidence here that it triggers acute CNV onset in AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect color perception by inducing retinal swelling?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD produces leakage and exudation at the macula that causes retinal and RPE swelling and disrupts macular photoreceptors; because the macula is essential for central and color vision, that swelling commonly produces blurred central vision and can impair color perception, and although reducing exudation can stabilize or improve function, permanent color loss may occur if photoreceptors are damaged.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history worsen AMD by causing direct retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"A family history of AMD is associated with increased risk and can worsen the disease, but there is no indication that family history directly induces retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; changes in RPE proliferation and loss are features of AMD itself, while RPE repair or regeneration is discussed in the context of therapeutic approaches like cell transplantation, stem-cell and tissue-engineering strategies rather than as a hereditary-driven regenerative process.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial damage?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF treatments for wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD reduce neovascular activity, exudation and subretinal fluid and improve anatomic and visual outcomes, which in turn can lessen secondary retinal pigment epithelial damage; however, they do not uniformly prevent RPE loss or long‑term atrophic progression in all patients, and some eyes show partial or no response, so RPE degeneration may still progress despite therapy.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking worsen AMD by causing immediate photoreceptor regeneration?,False,"Smoking is a well-established risk factor that aggravates and increases the likelihood of developing and progressing age-related macular degeneration, worsening visual outcomes and treatment responses; it does not trigger immediate photoreceptor regeneration—restoration of photoreceptors is a goal of targeted therapies such as stem cell or gene-based approaches, not an effect of smoking, and smoking cessation can help reduce further AMD progression.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD increase fall risk by reducing central visual acuity?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration commonly reduces central visual acuity and can produce central vision loss; that impairment undermines reading, driving, spatial perception and mobility, increases dependence and task errors, and thereby raises the risk of falls. Treatments such as anti–VEGF injections can improve central acuity and may help reduce that risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing immediate retinal detachment?,False,"High cholesterol, including altered HDL levels, has been linked to increased AMD risk, but there is no evidence that it does so by causing an immediate retinal detachment; retinal detachment is a separate, acute condition with different causes, and although chronic detachment and AMD can interact, high cholesterol–related AMD risk is not explained by an acute detachment mechanism.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial loss?,False,"AREDS-style vitamin and antioxidant supplements can slow progression of age-related macular degeneration and reduce the risk of severe vision loss in people with intermediate or high-risk dry AMD, but they do not reverse or restore loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells; cell-replacement approaches rather than nutritional supplements are the therapies aimed at replacing lost RPE.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD does cause rapid central vision loss, but this is due to choroidal neovascularization, exudation and resultant photoreceptor and RPE damage or loss rather than RPE regeneration; restoration of the RPE is a therapeutic goal (e.g., cell- or tissue-based approaches) rather than a process driven by the disease itself.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial inflammation?,True,"Yes. Obesity is associated with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and elevated inflammatory cytokines that can target the retina and activate inflammatory pathways in retinal pigment epithelial cells, promoting RPE dysfunction, drusen-related changes and neovascular or atrophic progression, and thereby increasing the risk and severity of age-related macular degeneration.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"No — progression from dry to wet AMD is not simply explained by excessive retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) repair. RPE dysfunction, loss, and abnormal RPE changes are central to AMD and are linked to the development of neovascular (wet) disease, but the switch involves complex processes—RPE degeneration, subretinal deposits and choroidal neovascularization with exudation—rather than a single overactive repair response. Interventions therefore target both RPE health and pathological neovascular growth.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing subretinal fluid accumulation?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy—especially verteporfin-based or vascular-targeted approaches—is an established treatment for neovascular (wet) AMD and related conditions and can help resolve subretinal fluid and improve vision in selected cases; however, intravitreal anti‑VEGF drugs remain the primary and most effective therapy for reducing subretinal fluid, with PDT typically used as an adjunct, alternative, or for specific subtypes such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV light exposure worsen AMD by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No — ultraviolet/blue light exposure is associated with oxidative stress, inflammation, reduced RPE function and increased RPE cell death that aggravate AMD, and it does not trigger immediate regeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium; true RPE recovery is achieved with experimental or therapeutic approaches such as stem‑cell or transplant strategies, and occasional reports that intermittent UV exposure can modify cellular phenotypes do not imply rapid in vivo RPE regeneration or protection from AMD progression.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair night vision by causing central retinal scarring?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD often produces leakage or hemorrhage beneath the macula that leads to scarring and fibrosis of the central retina; that scarring damages central vision and causes visual impairment, which can compromise night-time activities that rely on central vision such as reading or driving.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does hypertension increase AMD severity by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Hypertension is linked to increased occurrence and progression of AMD and to changes in the choroidal and retinal microvasculature, and it is also associated with an increase in retinal pigment epithelial volume (swelling); because RPE dysfunction and elevation contribute to worsening and neovascular forms of AMD, hypertension can plausibly worsen AMD severity by promoting RPE swelling.",True,False,True,False,Negative
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Yes. Smoking is a well-established risk factor that worsens AMD and can plausibly do so by damaging the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal microvasculature: tobacco exposure is associated with RPE volume loss and microvascular aging, which can promote retinal hypoxia and thereby drive abnormal vessel growth and greater AMD severity, including neovascular forms.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause blind spots by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No — dry (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration leads to degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, producing central blind spots and vision loss; it does not cause RPE regeneration, and restorative approaches focus on replacing or regenerating RPE to try to improve vision.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting changes in retinal blood flow?,True,"Yes — OCT angiography can image retinal and choroidal microvasculature and detect blood-flow changes and neovascularization that support the diagnosis of neovascular (wet) AMD, while conventional structural OCT excels at showing retinal layers and fluid (exudation) but does not directly measure flow; using OCTA together with structural OCT improves detection and assessment of wet AMD.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,False,"Diabetes is associated with an increased occurrence and future development of age-related macular degeneration, but there is no indication that diabetes directly or immediately causes retinal pigment epithelial detachment; such detachments are typically a manifestation of AMD (especially neovascular forms) or other specific retinal conditions rather than an instant consequence of diabetes itself.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect reading speed by inducing central retinal edema?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD often produces leakage from abnormal choroidal vessels that causes central macular edema, which impairs central vision and reduces reading speed; treating the edema (for example with anti‑VEGF therapy) and using low‑vision/reading aids or rehabilitation can improve retinal swelling and partially restore reading performance.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history worsen AMD by causing immediate choroidal thinning?,False,"A family history can increase risk for and worsen age-related macular degeneration, and AMD is associated with choroidal thinning, but there is no indication here that family history directly causes immediate choroidal thinning—any thinning is more likely an indirect consequence of AMD development or progression rather than an instant effect of familial risk.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing choroidal inflammation?,True,"Anti‑VEGF injections are effective for wet AMD because they suppress neovascular growth and resolve fluid, leading to improved anatomic and visual outcomes; this vascular and exudation control can indirectly reduce inflammatory signals associated with choroidal neovascularization and may improve treatment response when inflammation contributes to disease activity. However, intravitreal anti‑VEGF can also provoke ocular inflammation in some cases and is not primarily an anti‑inflammatory therapy, so dedicated anti‑inflammatory approaches may be needed when choroidal inflammation is a major driver.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Smoking is a well-established risk factor that increases the likelihood and severity of age-related macular degeneration and worsens macular pathology; available links point to smoking harming the retinal pigment epithelium (for example reducing RPE/Bruch’s complex volume) and promoting disease progression rather than inducing beneficial RPE regeneration, so smoking does not increase AMD risk by causing RPE regeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does smoking increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to higher risk and worse progression of age-related macular degeneration, and the evidence here indicates smoking harms the retinal pigment epithelium and retinal microvasculature (reducing RPE volume and accelerating microvascular aging), changes that can lead to retinal hypoxia and subsequent abnormal vessel growth and leakage that drive AMD. That pathway is supported indirectly by these connections—smoking-related RPE and vascular damage plausibly promote hypoxia—rather than by a single direct statement that smoking causes RPE hypoxia.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive dietary sugar intake alone?,False,"There is no evidence here that excessive dietary sugar by itself causes dry AMD to convert to wet AMD; progression to the neovascular, exudative form is driven by factors such as aging, inflammation, vascular changes and other systemic or genetic risks, and diet can influence disease course—antioxidants and lutein intake may help slow progression—but sugar alone is not shown as a sole cause of dry-to-wet conversion.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing retinal pigment epithelial susceptibility to oxidative stress?,True,"Family history is associated with increased AMD risk, and oxidative stress is a key driver of AMD that damages the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), contributing to disease progression; however, the available information does not directly demonstrate that familial risk specifically causes greater RPE susceptibility to oxidative stress, so that precise mechanistic link is not established.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing choroidal thinning?,False,"Anti-VEGF injections are an effective treatment for wet AMD by targeting neovascularization, reducing retinal fluid and lesion activity, and improving or preserving visual acuity, but they are not reported to reverse the choroidal thinning that is associated with AMD; they modify retinal and lesion thickness and control disease activity, yet choroidal thinning appears to be a feature of the underlying disease rather than a reversible effect of anti-VEGF therapy, and repeated injections can carry risks such as elevated intraocular pressure.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does atherosclerosis worsen AMD by causing direct retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,False,"While systemic atherosclerosis and related vascular/inflammatory processes are associated with age-related macular degeneration and may contribute to its severity, the evidence indicates that retinal pigment epithelial detachments arise chiefly from AMD-related local processes such as neovascularization and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy rather than being directly caused by atherosclerotic plaques; thus atherosclerosis may aggravate AMD indirectly through shared risk factors and vascular inflammation but is not shown to directly produce RPE detachments.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by assessing retinal blood flow changes?,False,"The Amsler grid is a simple subjective tool that can reveal central visual distortion or new symptoms suggestive of wet AMD, but it does not measure or detect retinal or choroidal blood‑flow changes; confirmation and assessment of the neovascular, exudative form and its vascular changes require clinical examination and objective imaging such as OCT angiography and other vascular tests.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"The available evidence does not support that UV exposure accelerates AMD by producing immediate retinal pigment epithelial swelling. Harmful light—particularly high‑energy/blue wavelengths and excessive exposure—is linked to oxidative stress, RPE dysfunction, cell loss and dry AMD over time, while some controlled intermittent UV exposures have even been reported to improve cellular and functional phenotypes in high‑risk AMD RPE cells; overall, the data point to chronic light‑induced damage rather than an acute UV‑triggered RPE swelling mechanism driving AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by repairing retinal blood vessels?,False,"AREDS-type vitamin and antioxidant supplements can slow progression of intermediate and some advanced dry AMD and reduce the risk of severe vision loss by supporting retinal health, but there is no evidence they work by repairing or regenerating retinal blood vessels; vascular repair or remodeling is addressed by other targeted vascular or regenerative therapies, and some AREDS formulations may influence the risk of conversion to neovascular AMD, so use should follow clinical guidance.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does obesity exacerbate AMD by increasing choroidal inflammation?,True,"Yes. Obesity is associated with systemic and ocular inflammatory changes and increased inflammatory mediators, and inflammation is a key driver of AMD pathology and choroidal neovascularization, so excess adiposity can exacerbate AMD—including advancing late-stage disease—at least in part by promoting choroidal inflammation.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by inducing subretinal fluid leakage?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD often produces choroidal neovascularization that leaks subretinal fluid; this fluid disrupts retinal structure and reduces visual acuity and can lead to an acute or sudden loss of vision, particularly with rapid lesion activity or associated hemorrhage, and prompt anti‑VEGF treatment can help reduce fluid and protect vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Diabetes is linked to AMD and other retinal disorders through vascular, metabolic, and degenerative effects on the retina, but there is no indication here that diabetes raises AMD risk by inducing immediate retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; AMD and RPE changes are related, yet the mechanism connecting diabetes to AMD appears to involve chronic retinal and vascular pathology rather than acute RPE regeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography reliably visualizes retinal pigment epithelial detachments, which are commonly seen in neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, and, together with OCT angiography and findings such as macular neovascularization and fluid, supports the diagnosis of wet AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking worsen dry AMD by promoting retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to higher risk and worse progression of dry AMD and is associated with retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and volume loss that promote RPE atrophy, accelerating progression to geographic atrophy and vision loss; quitting smoking can reduce this risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reversing retinal hypoxia?,False,"Retinal hypoxia is a key driver of the abnormal vessel growth and leakage that define wet AMD, and photodynamic therapy has been shown to reduce or prevent retinal hypoxia; therefore PDT could plausibly treat wet AMD by addressing the underlying hypoxic stimulus and might serve as a complementary or alternative approach—particularly in contexts where VEGF blockade, the current mainstay, is limited or may worsen hypoxia—though anti‑VEGF therapy remains the standard of care.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by eliminating retinal pigment epithelial damage?,False,"A diet rich in leafy green vegetables is associated with a lower risk and slower progression of age-related macular degeneration because it supplies carotenoids, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals that boost macular pigment and other protective factors; these nutrients can help mitigate retinal pigment epithelial damage and improve visual outcomes, but they do not completely eliminate RPE injury or guarantee prevention of disease, so dietary measures are best viewed as a helpful component of overall risk reduction rather than a cure.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by impairing retinal blood flow?,False,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration can lead to central and progressive vision loss that meets criteria for legal blindness: abnormal new vessels, leakage and exudation at the macula damage photoreceptors, and impaired retinal/choriocapillaris blood flow contributes to disease progression and cell loss. Imaging studies often show reduced macular blood flow in affected eyes, and while anti-VEGF injections reduce neovascular activity they also alter ocular blood flow, so despite treatment wet AMD remains a common cause of legal blindness, particularly in late stages.",True,False,True,False,Negative
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Evidence points to lipid buildup in the retinal pigment epithelium as a contributor to AMD, and higher circulating high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol has been associated with greater AMD risk; together this supports the plausibility that elevated cholesterol can promote AMD by driving RPE lipid accumulation, although this link is associative rather than definitively proven and other genetic and environmental factors also contribute.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to excessive retinal pigment epithelial inflammation?,True,"Yes. Dry (atrophic) AMD involves retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) degeneration and inflammatory activation, and excessive RPE inflammation and loss can promote exudation and choroidal neovascularization, driving progression to neovascular (wet) AMD with consequent vision loss; inflammatory mediators and inflammasome pathways in the RPE are implicated in this transition.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD impair depth perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration commonly produces central and overall visual impairment that leads to poor spatial perception and reduced depth perception; this stems from damage and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium rather than from retinal pigment epithelial regeneration. Regenerative or transplant therapies aim to replace lost RPE to improve visual outcomes, but AMD itself is linked to RPE degeneration and consequent vision deficits, not to RPE-driven restoration of depth perception.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing choroidal neovascular leakage?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy reduces leakage from choroidal neovascularization, which often stabilizes neovascular (wet) AMD and leads to improved anatomic outcomes and visual acuity for many patients; maintaining control commonly requires repeated dosing or newer combination approaches to suppress leakage, and a subset of patients may show partial or no response, waning efficacy over time, or treatment‑related adverse effects, so long‑term outcomes can vary.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Family history is linked to a higher risk of age-related macular degeneration, but the available information indicates that familial factors predispose to AMD rather than directly causing an immediate swelling of the retinal pigment epithelium; RPE swelling, elevation, proliferation or loss are manifestations that occur as part of AMD development—especially in neovascular/exudative stages—rather than an immediate consequence of family history.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause distorted vision by inducing choroidal edema?,True,"Yes. In wet (neovascular) AMD, abnormal choroidal blood vessels can leak and produce fluid accumulation in the macular/choroidal region, and that edema and disruption of the macula commonly lead to visual distortion and other vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it avoids retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Yes. Dry (atrophic) AMD reflects loss and impaired proliferation/repair of the retinal pigment epithelium, producing gradual atrophy of RPE and overlying retina and a slow, progressive decline in central vision; by contrast, exudative/neovascular disease produces more acute RPE disruption and faster changes, which is why cell- and tissue-based RPE repair strategies are being explored to slow dry AMD.",True,False,True,False,Negative
Can atherosclerosis exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"Yes — it is plausible that atherosclerosis could exacerbate AMD by promoting retinal hemorrhages that damage the retinal pigment epithelium: systemic vascular disease and other retinal vascular conditions are associated with retinal hemorrhages, and neovascular/exudative forms of AMD commonly involve hemorrhage and RPE involvement, so compromised retinal vasculature from atherosclerosis could worsen AMD via RPE hemorrhages; however, a direct causal link specifically tying atherosclerosis to RPE hemorrhages in AMD is not established from the provided information.",True,True,True,True,No Help
Does smoking worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Smoking is strongly linked to worse age-related macular degeneration and is associated with detrimental changes in the retinal pigment epithelium—including reduced RPE volume and increased lipid and oxidized-lipid deposits below the RPE—which are known to aggravate AMD, so smoking likely promotes AMD progression in part by increasing RPE lipid accumulation.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can OCT detect early dry AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial thinning?,True,"Yes. Spectral-domain OCT can detect early dry AMD by revealing retinal pigment epithelium thinning and associated outer retinal/outer segment thinning and subtle abnormalities in drusen-free areas, allowing visualization of early atrophic changes and supporting diagnosis of early non‑exudative AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by repairing retinal pigment epithelium?,False,"Anti-VEGF injections for wet (neovascular) AMD work by blocking abnormal blood-vessel growth and reducing fluid and leakage, which stabilizes or improves vision and prevents progression, but they do not repair or regenerate the damaged retinal pigment epithelium; RPE dysfunction is a core part of AMD and requires different, RPE-targeted approaches (such as cell-replacement or growth-factor strategies) to restore.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial oxidative stress?,True,"Yes. Oxidative stress in the retinal pigment epithelium is a key driver of AMD onset and progression—promoting mitochondrial dysfunction, cell senescence and death, aggravating RPE degeneration and ultimately impairing vision—so any condition that raises retinal/RPE oxidative stress, such as diabetes, can plausibly contribute to the development or worsening of AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy by causing choroidal neovascularization?,False,"No — dry (non‑neovascular) AMD progresses to geographic atrophy as part of the non‑neovascular disease pathway rather than by developing choroidal neovascularization; CNV is the hallmark of wet AMD and is not a required step for GA development, and while subclinical or quiescent CNV can sometimes influence GA progression (even appearing to slow atrophy in some cases), CNV is not the usual mechanism by which dry AMD becomes geographic atrophy.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase fall risk by impairing retinal pigment epithelial function?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly involves dysfunction and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium, which undermines retinal and central vision, produces blurred and progressive vision loss and impairments in spatial perception and mobility, and is associated with fall-relevant gait changes and increased dependence; through these vision-related deficits, AMD-mediated RPE impairment can meaningfully raise fall risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No — while ultraviolet exposure is implicated in ocular damage and may be associated with earlier or worsened age‑related macular degeneration through effects on the retinal pigment epithelium and vision, there is no evidence that UV triggers immediate RPE regeneration that accelerates AMD; reported cellular benefits from intermittent UV in some high‑risk RPE models do not equate to true retinal regeneration, which is instead achieved through stem‑cell and tissue‑engineering approaches.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. In the neovascular (wet) form of AMD, abnormal choroidal blood vessels leak and bleed beneath the retina, damaging the retinal pigment epithelium and promoting scarring and fibrosis; this RPE disruption and consequent photoreceptor loss can produce rapid, often irreversible central vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,False,"A diet rich in antioxidants can help reduce AMD risk and protect retinal pigment epithelium by reducing oxidative stress and preventing RPE cell loss, and dietary antioxidants are linked to slowing or improving AMD, but there is no evidence that such diets reverse established retinal pigment epithelial atrophy; they may help prevent or slow further degeneration, but they do not restore lost RPE tissue.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial fluid leakage?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to development and worsening of age-related macular degeneration, including the neovascular (wet) form, and AMD is associated with increased fluid leakage at the retinal pigment epithelium and subretinal space that impairs vision; because smoking alters macular and RPE structure (including reduced RPE/Bruch’s complex volume) and affects pathogenic pathways, it can plausibly exacerbate wet AMD by promoting RPE-related fluid leakage and worsening visual outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD affect color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"No — dry (atrophic) AMD is characterized by degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium rather than RPE swelling; RPE elevation or swelling is more typical of neovascular (wet) AMD. However, RPE loss and the resulting retinal damage in dry AMD can still impair central and color vision.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy, including verteporfin and vascular-targeted approaches, is used to treat wet/neovascular AMD and macular edema; because wet AMD commonly involves retinal and retinal pigment epithelium changes with edema, PDT can reduce the associated fluid/lesion activity and improve vision, though intravitreal anti‑VEGF agents are also effective at resolving retinal edema and are a mainstay of care.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing immediate retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Obesity is linked to a higher risk of age-related macular degeneration and to inflammatory, oxidative, metabolic, vascular, and neurodegenerative changes that aggravate retinal disease, but there is no indication that obesity increases AMD risk by causing immediate regeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium; instead, RPE proliferation is tied to the disease process itself and obesity appears to worsen AMD through damaging systemic and local mechanisms rather than by prompting rapid RPE repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair reading by inducing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD can impair reading: hypoxia in the outer retina can drive abnormal vessel growth and leakage, leading to RPE elevation or loss and central visual impairment, which produces blurred vision and difficulty reading.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does high cholesterol contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Although elevated high-density lipoprotein and high‑fat/high‑cholesterol diets are associated with AMD risk and AMD clearly alters retinal pigment epithelium proliferation and can cause RPE loss, there is no indication that high cholesterol promotes retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; regeneration efforts are linked to stem cell and tissue‑engineering approaches rather than cholesterol levels.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by reversing retinal pigment epithelial damage?,False,"AREDS supplements can slow or reduce progression of age-related macular degeneration—particularly in intermediate or high-risk and dry forms—and can improve outcomes over time, but they do not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial damage; repair of RPE loss is managed by other approaches and individual benefit can vary with genetic factors.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"No — wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD causes blind spots mainly by damaging the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors through exudation, RPE elevation or loss and resulting central retinal injury; any abnormal RPE proliferation or elevation seen in the disease reflects pathological change rather than effective repair, and true regenerative RPE recovery is limited, so RPE damage underlies the scotomas.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Yes. A positive family history is associated with higher risk of age-related macular degeneration, and AMD is characterized in part by lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, so family history can plausibly increase the likelihood of RPE lipid buildup indirectly by elevating AMD risk, although genetic and other mediating factors likely determine the exact effect.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are the standard treatment for neovascular (wet) AMD and work by reducing pathological fluid, exudation and lesion activity, which often decreases retinal pigment epithelial elevation or swelling and leads to morphological and functional improvement including better visual acuity. They are not a cure for underlying RPE degeneration, typically require ongoing injections, and carry potential risks and treatment burden.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV light increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"The available evidence does not support that UV light increases AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages. While solar and total UV exposure are linked to ocular disease and early AMD in general, there is no indication that UV directly induces RPE hemorrhages; RPE or retinal hemorrhages are more clearly associated with exudative AMD, vascular conditions, anticoagulation, intravitreal injections and other ocular diseases, and some data even suggest intermittent UV exposure can improve certain RPE cellular phenotypes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect face recognition by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD commonly produces exudation and edema involving the retinal pigment epithelium and surrounding retina, disrupting central macular function and causing central vision loss; because face recognition depends on intact central vision, RPE edema from wet AMD can impair the ability to recognize faces.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does atherosclerosis worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No — there is no indication that atherosclerosis worsens AMD by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration. Atherosclerosis is tied to vascular and inflammatory pathology that can be associated with AMD, but AMD is characterized by RPE dysfunction and loss rather than beneficial RPE proliferation; therapeutic efforts therefore aim to prevent RPE degeneration or restore RPE via transplantation, stem-cell therapies, and tissue engineering rather than relying on atherosclerosis-driven regeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to worsening of age-related macular degeneration, increasing the risk of progression to advanced disease and promoting retinal pigment epithelial atrophy (including geographic atrophy and loss of outer retinal layers); current smoking accelerates AMD progression and quitting smoking is associated with reduced risk of such atrophic changes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause gradual vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,No—dry AMD causes gradual central vision loss through degeneration and atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors rather than by inducing retinal pigment epithelium regeneration; regeneration is the aim of experimental therapies (for example cell transplantation or stem-cell approaches) rather than a natural outcome of the disease.,False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT confirm wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"OCT can visualize RPE lipid deposits like drusen and show RPE elevation, loss, or fluid that are associated with neovascular activity, but lipid deposits alone do not confirm wet AMD; confirmation requires evidence of active choroidal neovascularization or exudation, for which OCT (and OCT‑angiography) combined with clinical assessment and other imaging is used.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"Diabetes is linked to an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration through vascular and retinal changes, but the available information does not support a specific pathway in which diabetes causes retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages that then lead to AMD; retinal hemorrhages are seen with diabetic retinopathy and with neovascular (exudative) AMD, and RPE dysfunction is central to AMD, yet there is no direct evidence here that diabetes induces RPE hemorrhages as the mediating mechanism.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD commonly produces retinal pigment epithelial detachments, and these detachments can worsen visual acuity and produce sudden changes in vision—especially when complicated by bleeding or an RPE tear—so prompt ophthalmic evaluation is important.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history elevate AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Family history clearly raises the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, but it is not shown to directly cause retinal pigment epithelial swelling. Instead, inherited risk increases the chance of AMD, and certain AMD subtypes—notably exudative/neovascular disease—can produce RPE elevation or proliferation and associated exudative changes, so any connection between family history and RPE swelling is indirect via increased AMD risk.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Anti‑VEGF therapy is effective at stabilizing wet (neovascular) AMD by blocking VEGF-driven abnormal vessel growth and reducing leakage and subretinal fluid, which improves anatomic and visual outcomes; however, the information provided links retinal hypoxia to vessel growth but does not indicate that anti‑VEGF directly relieves hypoxia of the retinal pigment epithelium, so its benefit is mainly by countering the downstream VEGF-mediated consequences rather than correcting underlying RPE oxygenation.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Does smoking increase dry AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No — smoking does increase the risk and progression of age‑related macular degeneration, including the dry/atrophic form, but the evidence points to smoking causing retinal pigment epithelium damage, dysfunction, volume loss and atrophy rather than promoting RPE regeneration; smoking is linked to earlier onset, advanced disease and worse AMD features, not regenerative repair of the RPE.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair driving by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet/exudative) AMD involves leaky vessels and exudation that can produce retinal and retinal pigment epithelial edema or elevation, and these RPE/retinal changes lead to central vision loss, blurred vision and impaired visual function that reduce driving performance and safety; reducing the edema with treatments such as anti‑VEGF therapy can improve retinal status, which further supports the causal link between wet AMD–related RPE edema and driving impairment.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does high cholesterol exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"The evidence links elevated high‑density lipoprotein cholesterol with increased AMD risk and shows that AMD involves retinal pigment epithelium changes (altered proliferation, loss, and consequent vision impairment), but there is no indication that high cholesterol exacerbates AMD specifically by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair; the associations point to cholesterol-related risk and diet‑linked harmful changes rather than a cholesterol-driven RPE reparative mechanism.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by reversing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"AREDS-style vitamin and antioxidant supplements can lower the risk of progression in age-related macular degeneration, especially at intermediate stages, but they are not known to reverse retinal pigment epithelial swelling or elevations; structural RPE changes are features of advanced or neovascular disease and generally require other targeted treatments rather than supplementation alone.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD can impair depth perception because the disease produces retinal damage, exudation and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) dysfunction or loss that disrupt central and spatial vision. The idea that depth perception problems are caused by AMD triggering RPE repair is not supported; AMD more typically involves RPE elevation, loss or dysfunction, and the resulting visual deficits—rather than any RPE “repair” process—underlie depth perception difficulties, though RPE-replacement therapies are being explored to try to improve outcomes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Obesity alters lipid metabolism and raises oxidative stress and inflammation, promoting accumulation of lipid and oxidized-lipid material beneath the retinal pigment epithelium and thereby increasing the risk, severity, and progression of age-related macular degeneration and related visual loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No — dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can progress to geographic atrophy, but GA is characterized by loss and degeneration of retinal pigment epithelial cells and photoreceptors rather than being caused by RPE regeneration; efforts to restore or replace RPE (cell transplantation or regenerative therapies) are being studied to prevent or treat atrophy, not because RPE regeneration drives the disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Photodynamic therapy can be used to treat wet (neovascular) AMD by targeting abnormal choroidal blood vessels and can improve anatomical and visual outcomes in some cases, but there is no clear evidence that its beneficial effect is due to reducing hypoxia in the retinal pigment epithelium; because retinal hypoxia can drive abnormal vessel growth and leakage, therapies that directly relieve hypoxia would be conceptually attractive, yet photodynamic therapy is primarily a vascular-targeting treatment rather than a proven method to correct RPE hypoxia.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No—current information does not support the idea that UV exposure increases AMD risk by triggering retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regeneration. Light, especially blue light, is more consistently linked to RPE damage, oxidative stress, cell death, and features of dry AMD, while RPE regeneration is discussed as a therapeutic aim (e.g., stem cell or tissue-engineering approaches) rather than a pathogenic mechanism; some reports even note that controlled/intermittent UV exposure can improve cellular phenotypes in high‑risk RPE cells, but there is no clear evidence that UV-induced RPE regeneration drives AMD development.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by inducing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD can lead to retinal pigment epithelial and outer retinal atrophy with resultant central vision loss, and vision loss/retinal deafferentation from ocular disease is a well-established trigger for visual hallucinations (such as Charles Bonnet syndrome); thus wet AMD that produces significant RPE atrophy and visual impairment can provoke visual hallucinations.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does atherosclerosis contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"The information links atherosclerosis to vascular and inflammatory dysfunction and links age-related macular degeneration to retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities, but it does not provide direct evidence that atherosclerosis specifically causes retinal pigment epithelial swelling; the data suggest a possible indirect contribution through vascular or inflammatory pathways, yet a direct causal role for atherosclerosis in RPE swelling is not demonstrated.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking increase AMD severity by promoting retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to more severe and late-stage AMD and to the neovascular form that drives chronic leakage, hemorrhage, fibrosis and retinal pigment epithelial scarring; smoking also promotes inflammation, microvascular damage and matrix changes that favor scar formation and worse RPE-related visual outcomes, and cessation is associated with reduced progression.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD impair reading by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"No — dry (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration impairs reading by causing retinal pigment epithelium degeneration and loss of central macular function, leading to central vision loss and difficulty reading; RPE repair or replacement is a therapeutic strategy under investigation, not the mechanism by which dry AMD reduces reading ability.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT detect early AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography, particularly spectral-domain OCT (and OCT angiography), can identify the structural RPE changes tied to lipid accumulation—features such as drusen, hyperreflective foci, outer retinal thinning and other RPE abnormalities—and thus is a valuable tool for detecting early age-related macular degeneration by visualizing lipid-related RPE changes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"The provided information does not support the idea that diabetes worsens age-related macular degeneration by causing retinal pigment epithelium regeneration; rather, AMD itself is linked to alterations in RPE proliferation and to RPE loss or elevation in different subtypes, RPE dysfunction contributes to vision loss, and regenerative or cell-based therapies are considered as treatment approaches, with no direct connection to diabetes described.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect color perception by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes—neovascular (wet) AMD often produces leakage and hemorrhage from choroidal neovascular lesions that lead to scarring and fibrosis of the retinal pigment epithelium; RPE loss and dysfunction damage the macula and photoreceptors, causing central visual impairment and can alter or reduce color perception.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"A family history of AMD is associated with increased risk and worsening of the disease; when AMD progresses to exudative/neovascular forms it can produce retinal and retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages. Thus family history may indirectly raise the chance of RPE hemorrhages by promoting AMD progression, but it is not shown to directly cause RPE hemorrhages on its own.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Anti-VEGF injections are effective for treating wet (neovascular) AMD by resolving exudation and improving anatomical and visual outcomes, but they do not reduce retinal pigment epithelial atrophy; neovascular control and fluid reduction do not prevent progression of RPE atrophy, which is being targeted by other experimental strategies such as cell transplantation or growth‑factor approaches rather than by anti-VEGF therapy alone.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does smoking worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"No — smoking is a clear risk factor that worsens age-related macular degeneration, but it does so by damaging the retinal pigment epithelium and promoting disease progression rather than by inducing beneficial RPE repair; evidence links smoking to RPE loss and reduced RPE volume and to increased risk of advanced AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD increase fall risk by inducing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Yes. In wet (neovascular) AMD, retinal hypoxia drives abnormal vessel growth and leakage that compromise and sometimes lift or destroy the retinal pigment epithelium, producing central vision loss and degraded spatial perception and mobility; those visual deficits and increased dependency raise the risk of falls.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Does high cholesterol increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Data indicate that higher levels of certain cholesterol components, particularly high‑density lipoprotein, are associated with greater AMD risk, and AMD itself features retinal pigment epithelial changes (proliferation, elevation and loss) that contribute to vision loss; however, the available information does not show a direct causal chain in which high cholesterol produces retinal pigment epithelial swelling, so it cannot be concluded that cholesterol increases AMD risk specifically by causing RPE swelling.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,False,"AREDS-type nutritional supplements can slow progression of intermediate and some forms of dry AMD and reduce the risk of severe vision loss, but they are understood as antioxidant/nutritional therapy rather than a means to reverse retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia or restore RPE dysfunction and atrophy; benefits vary by disease stage and genotype, and some formulations may influence the risk of converting to neovascular AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD does cause rapid, often irreversible central vision loss, but this is driven by abnormal choroidal neovascularization, exudation and photoreceptor/RPE damage rather than by a beneficial repair response of the retinal pigment epithelium; the wet form is associated with RPE loss and structural disruption that worsens visual outcomes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Yes. Obesity is associated with higher risk and worsening of age‑related macular degeneration, including progression to late AMD, and AMD commonly features retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy; obesity’s links with systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, lipid alterations and direct effects on the retina make it likely that excess weight can promote RPE atrophy and thereby increase AMD risk and progression.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial swelling alone?,False,"No — swelling of the retinal pigment epithelium alone does not by itself explain progression from dry to wet AMD. Changes in the RPE, including elevation, loss, or dysfunction, are commonly seen with neovascular/exudative disease and can signal risk, but the conversion to wet AMD requires development of abnormal new blood vessels and exudation; RPE swelling may accompany or contribute to that process but is not the sole cause.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Photodynamic therapy, including verteporfin- and vascular-targeted approaches, is used to treat neovascular (wet) AMD and associated choroidal neovascularization; by occluding abnormal vessels it can reduce exudation, leakage and hemorrhage that contribute to retinal pigment epithelial disruption and subsequent scarring, so it may help limit RPE scarring in some cases, but it does not reliably prevent chronic scarring or RPE loss from progressive CNV and is often used alongside or superseded by intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy for optimal visual outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV light exposure worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"Exposure to short‑wavelength light (blue/UV) can injure retinal pigment epithelial cells through oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death and is implicated in AMD progression, but there is no direct evidence here that UV/blue light causes retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages; hemorrhages are instead associated with neovascular (exudative) AMD and other vascular eye diseases, so UV exposure may exacerbate RPE dysfunction and AMD risk without being shown to directly provoke RPE hemorrhages.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair night vision by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD causes leaky vessels and exudation that produce retinal and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) edema or elevation; RPE dysfunction or loss disrupts retinal function and leads to visual impairment, so RPE edema from wet AMD can contribute to impaired night vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does atherosclerosis increase AMD severity by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No — the information does not support that atherosclerosis worsens age-related macular degeneration by causing retinal pigment epithelium regeneration. AMD is linked to RPE proliferation and loss, and AMD and atherosclerosis are associated through shared vascular and inflammatory processes, but atherosclerosis is described in terms of vascular damage and inflammation rather than as a trigger for RPE regeneration; regenerative approaches are therapeutic, not a consequence of atherosclerosis.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Smoking is consistently linked to higher risk and worse progression of age-related macular degeneration and can impact retinal pigment epithelium structure and function; because AMD is characterized by pathogenic lipid accumulation in the RPE, smoking could plausibly exacerbate AMD by promoting or worsening RPE lipid buildup.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause blind spots by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"No — dry (atrophic) AMD produces blind spots because loss and dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors lead to central scotomas; while AMD alters RPE behavior, the vision loss stems from RPE degeneration rather than RPE-driven repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"OCT is a key tool for diagnosing neovascular (wet) AMD because it directly visualizes macular neovascularization, fluid and structural changes and can reveal macular atrophy and early signs of retinal pigment epithelial atrophy by showing loss of outer retinal and RPE layers; however, FAF, color fundus photography and OCT angiography often provide complementary information and are frequently used alongside OCT to confirm RPE atrophy and fully characterize wet AMD.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Diabetes is linked to a higher risk and future development of age-related macular degeneration through effects on the retina, choroidal blood flow and vascular structure and by promoting retinal/macular edema; the retinal pigment epithelium is key in AMD and neovascular AMD can show RPE elevation, but the evidence here does not support a direct claim that diabetes increases AMD risk specifically by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling—its impact is more likely mediated by vascular, metabolic and inflammatory changes that secondarily affect the RPE.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect reading speed by inducing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) AMD, hypoxia in the retinal pigment epithelium can drive abnormal vessel growth and RPE dysfunction or loss, leading to central vision impairment and reading difficulty; that loss of central visual function commonly reduces reading speed.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Family history is linked to increased risk and greater severity of AMD, but the information provided does not support the idea that family history worsens AMD by directly causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; rather, AMD itself is associated with alterations in RPE proliferation and loss, and those RPE changes drive visual decline while familial factors likely act by increasing susceptibility to the disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Anti-VEGF therapy effectively treats the neovascular (wet/exudative) form of AMD by reducing abnormal blood vessels, subretinal fluid, and improving vision, but there’s no indication that it reduces retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits (such as drusen or oxidized lipids); those deposits are implicated in disease progression and are more directly targeted by approaches addressing oxidative stress or RPE replacement.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"Smoking is a clear risk factor for age-related macular degeneration and can worsen its progression. Bleeding in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium is a feature of the neovascular (exudative) form of AMD. The evidence points to smoking increasing AMD risk and damaging the RPE or promoting progression to hemorrhage-prone neovascular disease, but it does not show smoking directly causing isolated retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages.",False,True,False,True,Positive
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial inflammation?,True,"Yes. Smoking is a well-established risk factor for age-related macular degeneration and is associated with damage to the retinal pigment epithelium—including reduced RPE/Bruch’s membrane volume and proinflammatory changes—and because RPE dysfunction and inflammation are central drivers of AMD, smoking likely increases AMD risk at least in part by promoting RPE inflammation and injury.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive dietary salt intake alone?,False,"Based on the information provided, there is no indication that excessive dietary salt by itself causes dry AMD to convert to the neovascular (wet) form; AMD progression to exudative/neovascular disease is part of the condition’s natural course and is linked to factors like age, inflammatory markers and overall diet, with antioxidants and lutein noted as potentially protective, but salt-alone causation is not supported.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing retinal pigment epithelial vulnerability to hypoxia?,True,"Family history is associated with increased risk of AMD, and AMD is clearly linked with retinal hypoxia and retinal pigment epithelial dysfunction—hypoxia can worsen RPE degeneration and promote disease progression. However, the information provided does not directly demonstrate that familial risk specifically increases RPE susceptibility to hypoxia; that mechanism is plausible but not established here.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,False,"Anti‑VEGF injections are effective at treating the neovascular (wet) form of age‑related macular degeneration by suppressing choroidal neovascularization, reducing fluid and disease activity, and improving visual acuity, but they do not reverse retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy; RPE loss is a feature of AMD that is not restored by anti‑VEGF therapy and may continue to progress despite treatment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does hyperlipidemia worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"Hyperlipidemia is associated with the development or worsening of age-related macular degeneration, and neovascular/exudative AMD can produce retinal and retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages; however, the information provided does not demonstrate a direct causal pathway in which hyperlipidemia specifically causes retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages that then worsen AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by assessing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"The Amsler grid is a simple subjective tool that can reveal central visual distortions and help monitor early or intermediate macular disease, but it cannot objectively assess retinal pigment epithelial regeneration or directly diagnose wet (neovascular) AMD; definitive detection and evaluation of wet AMD and RPE status rely on clinical examination and imaging modalities, and RPE recovery or regenerative therapies are tracked with objective tests rather than the Amsler grid.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,False,"The provided evidence does not support a direct link that UV exposure accelerates AMD by producing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits; instead, light—especially blue or excessive exposure—is tied to RPE oxidative stress, cell death, lipofuscin accumulation and functional impairment, and oxidized lipid deposits are associated with worse AMD, while some reports even indicate intermittent UV exposure can improve high‑risk RPE cell phenotypes, so a specific UV→RPE lipid‑deposit→AMD causal chain is not demonstrated.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by regenerating retinal pigment epithelial cells?,False,"AREDS-type nutritional supplements can slow progression of intermediate dry AMD and reduce the risk of severe vision loss, but they do not regenerate or replace damaged retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells; RPE restoration typically requires cell-based reparative approaches such as stem-cell–derived RPE transplantation, and the clinical benefit of supplements also depends on disease stage and individual factors like genetics.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does obesity exacerbate AMD by promoting retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Yes—obesity is linked to higher risk and worse progression of AMD, and it appears to do so by promoting systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and microvascular dysfunction that impair retinal perfusion and foster retinal hypoxia; retinal hypoxia drives abnormal vessel growth and barrier leakage and damages the retinal pigment epithelium, accelerating RPE dysfunction, AMD progression and vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes—neovascular (wet/exudative) AMD involves leaky abnormal choroidal vessels and exudation that can cause retinal and retinal pigment epithelial edema or elevation, and these changes (often with hemorrhage or photoreceptor damage) can produce rapid or sudden central vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Some sources link diabetes to retinal disease and to increased occurrence or influence on age-related macular degeneration, and AMD is clearly associated with changes in the retinal pigment epithelium (loss, dysfunction or abnormal proliferation), but there is no evidence here that diabetes increases AMD risk by driving retinal pigment epithelial repair—diabetes-related effects are described more in vascular and retinal terms than as provoking RPE repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography visualizes retinal layers and microstructures and can demonstrate retinal pigment epithelial elevation, loss and fibrotic/scar tissue associated with neovascular (wet) age‑related macular degeneration, enabling diagnosis of macular neovascularization, exudation and scarring; OCT angiography further improves detection of the underlying choroidal neovascular lesions and subretinal fibrosis, making OCT/OCTA central tools for identifying RPE scarring in wet AMD alongside clinical assessment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking worsen dry AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"The information indicates that smoking is linked to increased risk and worsening of dry age-related macular degeneration and can impair retinal pigment epithelial structure and function, while dry AMD is associated with lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium; however, a direct causal connection showing that smoking specifically increases retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation as the mechanism for worsening dry AMD is not demonstrated here—smoking may plausibly contribute indirectly via RPE dysfunction, impaired clearance and aging-related processes that favor lipid build-up, but explicit evidence of that exact pathway is lacking.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial damage?,False,"Photodynamic therapy can reduce abnormal blood vessel activity and exudation in wet age-related macular degeneration and may stabilize or improve anatomy and vision, but it does not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial loss or regenerate damaged RPE tissue—restoring RPE function typically requires reparative approaches such as cell transplantation or other regenerative therapies.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by repairing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,False,"Diets high in leafy greens are associated with lower risk and may slow age-related macular degeneration through increased antioxidants, vitamins and carotenoids that boost macular pigment and provide protective effects, and nutritional interventions can influence AMD progression; however, there is no clear evidence that leafy greens specifically repair retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia—hypoxia contributes to neovascular and permeability changes in AMD, but the dietary benefits appear to be nutrient-mediated protection rather than direct reversal of RPE oxygen deficiency.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) age-related macular degeneration can lead to central vision loss and progress to legal blindness through neovascularization, exudation, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) loss and subsequent photoreceptor death. RPE regeneration is a reparative concept pursued by therapies (for example stem-cell or cell transplantation) and is not the process by which wet AMD causes blindness; loss, not regeneration, drives the visual decline.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does hyperlipidemia increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial inflammation?,True,"Available evidence links hyperlipidemia to increased AMD risk and independently implicates retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and inflammatory mediators (e.g., IL‑1, TNF‑α, NLRP3, CRP) in AMD, while lipid-related factors can alter RPE biology and promote inflammation; together these patterns make it plausible that hyperlipidemia contributes to AMD by promoting RPE inflammation, although a direct, explicitly demonstrated causal chain from hyperlipidemia to RPE inflammation to AMD is not shown in the provided information.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"Yes. Hypoxia of the retinal pigment epithelium can induce abnormal vessel growth and increased vascular leakage, so RPE dysfunction and hypoxic signaling can drive development of choroidal neovascularization and exudation, producing the switch from atrophic (dry) AMD to neovascular (wet) AMD with attendant RPE changes and vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD impair color perception by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration impairs color perception primarily by damaging the macula and retinal pigment epithelium, causing central vision and color losses; the condition is associated with RPE degeneration or dysfunction rather than RPE-driven repair as the cause of color impairment, and restorative approaches focus on replacing or repairing RPE to preserve vision.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial fluid leakage?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF treatment for wet (neovascular) AMD reduces pathologic neovascular leakage, often decreasing subretinal, intraretinal and sub‑RPE fluid, which stabilizes the disease and improves anatomical and visual outcomes; however responses vary (partial response or nonresponse occur) and repeated treatment with monitoring is typically required.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"A family history of AMD raises the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, but it does not directly cause retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages; those hemorrhages are typically a feature of exudative/neovascular AMD, so family history can be indirectly associated with RPE hemorrhages by increasing the chance of developing the disease that produces them.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause wavy vision by inducing retinal pigment epithelial detachment?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD can lead to retinal pigment epithelial detachments, and those detachments and the associated choroidal neovascularization commonly impair visual acuity and cause blurred or distorted vision, which can present as wavy vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it avoids retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Yes. Dry (atrophic) AMD generally progresses more slowly than neovascular (wet) AMD in part because it lacks the exudation and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) elevation/swelling that drive rapid damage in the neovascular form; nevertheless, dry AMD still involves RPE degeneration and loss that cause gradual central vision decline and geographic atrophy.",True,True,True,True,No Help
Can hyperlipidemia exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration is closely tied to retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction—including elevation, loss, proliferation changes and exudation—and lipid-related factors and apolipoproteins are implicated in influencing the epithelium and AMD risk, so it is biologically plausible that systemic lipid abnormalities could worsen AMD by promoting retinal pigment epithelial swelling, particularly in neovascular or exudative forms; however, the information provided does not directly demonstrate that hyperlipidemia causes such swelling, so direct evidence is lacking.",True,True,True,True,No Help
Does smoking worsen AMD by promoting retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Smoking is clearly linked to worse AMD and a higher risk of advanced and neovascular forms, and AMD itself is associated with retinal edema and a range of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) abnormalities; smoking also damages RPE structure. However, the available information does not explicitly show that smoking directly promotes retinal pigment epithelial edema, so while smoking likely worsens AMD via RPE injury and other pathways, a specific causal role in promoting RPE edema is not demonstrated here.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Can OCT detect early dry AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Yes. Spectral-domain OCT can identify early dry AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy and associated outer retinal and photoreceptor thinning, and OCT-based automated analyses can detect RPE/outer retinal atrophy, often used alongside FAF and color fundus imaging to confirm RPE loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by reversing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,False,"Anti‑VEGF intravitreal injections effectively treat wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD by blocking VEGF-driven abnormal blood vessel growth and reducing exudation and fluid, improving visual acuity and disease activity; although retinal/RPE hypoxia can promote neovascularization and leakage, the evidence here indicates anti‑VEGF works by inhibiting VEGF-mediated angiogenesis and permeability rather than by reversing retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"The information shows that lipid and oxidized lipid accumulation at or beneath the retinal pigment epithelium and RPE dysfunction are implicated in AMD development and vision loss. However, there is no direct evidence here linking diabetes to increased RPE lipid deposits. Thus diabetes could only be said to plausibly worsen AMD via that mechanism if it were shown to raise such deposits, but that specific causal connection is not established in the supplied information.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"No — dry age-related macular degeneration progresses to geographic atrophy through degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors, rather than by inducing RPE repair; geographic atrophy is characterized by RPE loss, and interventions focus on preserving or replacing RPE cells rather than relying on endogenous RPE proliferation to drive the atrophic transition.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase fall risk by impairing retinal pigment epithelial acuity?,True,"Yes—AMD can raise fall risk by damaging the retinal pigment epithelium: RPE loss or dysfunction in AMD contributes to central and overall vision decline (blurred vision, reduced spatial perception and motion sensitivity), which leads to impaired mobility, gait changes, difficulty with daily tasks and increased dependence, all of which elevate the likelihood of falls.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"The material indicates that UV/solar exposure is associated with age‑related ocular disease and early AMD, and that retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and retinal edema are important features of AMD that drive vision loss; however, there is no clear evidence here that UV exposure specifically induces retinal pigment epithelial edema or that UV‑driven RPE edema is the mechanism accelerating AMD—in fact some provided data even suggest intermittent UV exposure can improve certain AMD RPE cell phenotypes—so a direct causal pathway UV → RPE edema → accelerated AMD is not supported by the available statements.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Yes. The wet (neovascular) form of AMD is known to cause rapid, often irreversible vision loss, and AMD is associated with lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium; RPE dysfunction from such lipid build‑up can contribute to visual decline, so RPE lipid accumulation is a plausible contributing mechanism by which wet AMD leads to rapid vision loss.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,False,A diet rich in antioxidants is linked to reduced risk and some improvement of age-related macular degeneration—likely by countering oxidative stress—but the available connections do not support the idea that high-antioxidant diets actually reverse established lipid deposits beneath the retinal pigment epithelium (drusen); they appear more preventive or disease-modifying than curative for existing subretinal lipid accumulation.,False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to higher risk and more severe, advanced AMD including the neovascular (wet) form, and wet AMD produces choroidal neovascularization with chronic leakage and hemorrhage that drives scarring and fibrosis of the retinal pigment epithelium; smoking also worsens disease features and treatment outcomes, so it can reasonably exacerbate wet AMD by promoting RPE scarring and poorer vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD affect depth perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"No — dry (atrophic) AMD does not typically cause retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages; hemorrhages are a feature of the neovascular/exudative form. However, dry AMD damages the retinal pigment epithelium and macula, causing central vision loss and impaired spatial perception, which can reduce depth perception and affect mobility.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Photodynamic therapy is an approved option for treating the wet (neovascular) form of AMD by targeting abnormal choroidal blood vessels and can help stabilize or improve vision, but there is no indication here that it specifically removes or reduces lipid deposits beneath the retinal pigment epithelium; addressing those lipid/oxidized deposits is more directly linked to approaches that reduce oxidative stress or target RPE preservation or replacement.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Obesity is linked to a higher risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence does not indicate that this occurs by obesity inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair; rather, obesity is associated with inflammation, oxidative stress and other harmful effects on the retina that promote AMD progression, while altered retinal pigment epithelium proliferation or loss is described as part of AMD pathology rather than a repair mechanism driven by obesity.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair reading by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) AMD, abnormal subretinal neovascularization can leak and bleed, damaging the retinal pigment epithelium and producing scarring and fibrosis at the macula; that RPE loss and macular scarring cause central visual impairment, which commonly produces difficulty reading.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does hyperlipidemia contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"Hyperlipidemia is associated with age-related macular degeneration, and AMD can feature retinal edema and various retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities, but the available information does not show a direct pathway by which hyperlipidemia causes AMD specifically through retinal pigment epithelial edema; retinal edema is more directly linked to leaky blood vessels, so a causal role of hyperlipidemia via RPE edema remains unestablished.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,False,"AREDS supplements have evidence of slowing progression of intermediate and certain advanced dry forms of AMD and improving patient outcomes, and nutritional supplementation more broadly can affect AMD progression, but there is no indication here that AREDS work by reversing lipid buildup in the retinal pigment epithelium; lipid accumulation is implicated in AMD pathogenesis and appears to be modifiable by other targeted interventions (for example via pathways like LXR activation), and genetic factors can also influence how supplements perform.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by inducing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) AMD, abnormal leaking vessels and exudation commonly cause elevation and swelling of the retinal pigment epithelium, which disrupts photoreceptors and produces central blind spots (scotomas) and progressive central vision loss.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"Yes. A positive family history is linked to higher risk of age-related macular degeneration, and AMD—particularly exudative/neovascular forms—often produces RPE changes and fluid/exudation from leaky vessels, manifesting as retinal pigment epithelial edema. Thus family history can increase the likelihood of RPE edema indirectly by predisposing to the forms of AMD that cause RPE swelling and exudative changes.",True,True,True,True,No Help
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Lipid-rich deposits beneath the retinal pigment epithelium, including drusen and oxidized lipids, can impair RPE function and aggravate age-related macular degeneration, and are associated with RPE changes and neovascularization that increase the likelihood of progression from dry (atrophic) AMD to wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,True,"Yes. Injections of anti‑VEGF into the eye are the standard therapy for wet (neovascular) AMD: by suppressing abnormal choroidal blood vessel growth and reducing fluid/exudation they commonly reduce bleeding associated with the disease, including hemorrhages involving the retinal pigment epithelium, which helps stabilize or improve vision. These benefits must be weighed against the need for repeated treatments and potential injection‑related risks such as raised intraocular pressure and other complications.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV light increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"The information suggests that solar or total UV exposure is linked to early age-related macular degeneration and other age-related ocular disease, and that AMD involves retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) abnormalities—including RPE elevation or loss that can impair vision—but there is no direct evidence here that UV exposure specifically increases AMD risk by causing RPE swelling, and some notes even indicate intermittent UV can improve certain cellular phenotypes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect face recognition by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration involves retinal pigment epithelium pathology, including lipid accumulation, that contributes to macular dysfunction and central vision loss; because face recognition depends on central visual function, these RPE changes in wet AMD can impair the ability to recognize faces.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does hyperlipidemia worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Hyperlipidemia is linked with an increased risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration, and AMD is characterized by retinal pigment epithelium changes (including proliferation and loss) that drive visual decline; however, there is no indication in the provided evidence that hyperlipidemia worsens AMD specifically by inducing retinal pigment epithelial repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to increased risk and progression of AMD and is associated with development of neovascular (wet) disease, which commonly produces retinal and retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages; by promoting microvascular aging and advancing AMD severity, smoking makes RPE hemorrhages and their vision‑threatening consequences more likely.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause gradual vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Dry (atrophic) AMD does cause gradual loss of central vision, but this is typically due to degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors rather than RPE swelling; RPE elevation or swelling is more characteristic of the neovascular (wet) form.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT confirm wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. OCT readily shows retinal and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) elevation/edema and intraretinal or subretinal fluid—hallmarks of neovascular (wet) AMD—so it strongly supports and often helps confirm a wet-AMD diagnosis; OCT angiography can further reveal neovascular changes, though final diagnosis is made in the context of clinical examination and complementary imaging.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD is associated with retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits and lipid/oxidative material contributes to disease progression, but sudden vision changes are usually caused by acute neovascular complications—exudation, RPE elevation or tear, or submacular hemorrhage—rather than the slow accumulation of sub‑RPE lipid alone.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does family history elevate AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"A family history does raise the risk of age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence does not support the idea that family history directly causes retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; rather, genetic predisposition increases AMD risk, and AMD itself is associated with altered retinal pigment epithelial proliferation, loss, and other RPE changes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy effectively treats neovascular (wet) AMD by suppressing choroidal neovascular activity, reducing exudation and subretinal fluid, and improving anatomic and visual outcomes, which in turn can limit the processes that drive retinal pigment epithelial scarring and help stabilize the disease in many patients. However, it does not universally prevent RPE scarring or fibrosis—chronic leakage, hemorrhage, incomplete or waning responses, and long‑term disease processes can still lead to scarring and vision loss in some eyes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking increase dry AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Smoking does increase the risk of dry AMD, but the evidence here does not support that it does so by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling; instead smoking is linked with RPE volume decrease and with RPE dysfunction, atrophy and other degenerative changes that contribute to dry AMD.",False,True,False,True,Positive
Can wet AMD impair driving by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD commonly involves lipid-rich subretinal and sub‑RPE deposits and RPE elevation or loss, causing retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and central vision impairment, and those central-vision deficits are linked to reduced driving performance, difficulty driving, and poorer driving safety.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does hyperlipidemia exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"The provided information associates hyperlipidemia with age-related macular degeneration and describes AMD as involving multiple retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) abnormalities—proliferation, elevation/structural changes, and loss—so it is plausible that hyperlipidemia can exacerbate AMD via effects on the RPE; however, a direct, specific assertion that hyperlipidemia causes RPE swelling is not explicitly established by the supplied statements.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by reversing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"AREDS-type vitamin and antioxidant supplements can reduce the risk of progression in AMD and improve outcomes in intermediate or dry forms, but there’s no indication they reverse retinal pigment epithelial edema; edema in AMD is typically related to leaky blood vessels and is managed with targeted therapies such as ranibizumab rather than nutritional supplements.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD commonly produces central vision loss and impaired spatial and motion perception that can reduce depth perception, but this is driven by macular and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage, elevation or loss rather than by a natural RPE regenerative response; the macula has very limited ability to regenerate on its own, and restoring RPE is the focus of experimental therapies rather than a spontaneous mechanism by which wet AMD would improve depth perception.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Obesity is linked with worse AMD and can promote conditions that lead to retinal pigment epithelial swelling—systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and microvascular dysfunction associated with obesity can increase vascular leakage and exudation, contributing to RPE elevation/edema and thereby worsening AMD and its progression to more severe, late stages.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Yes. Dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can progress to geographic atrophy, but GA represents localized atrophy with loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors rather than being driven primarily by RPE swelling; RPE degeneration and related changes underlie the transition to GA.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"The data show that treatments can address wet (neovascular) AMD and that retinal pigment epithelial atrophy is a feature of AMD, and while some therapies aim to slow disease progression or target geographic atrophy, photodynamic therapy is not specifically documented here as reducing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, so there is no direct support that PDT treats wet AMD by reducing RPE atrophy.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"The information shows that high-energy light (notably blue light) can injure the retinal pigment epithelium via oxidative stress, cell death, barrier compromise and functional decline, and that RPE dysfunction is central to AMD development; AMD can also present retinal edema, typically linked to leaky vessels in neovascular disease. However, the data do not clearly establish a direct causal chain in which UV exposure specifically produces RPE edema that then increases AMD risk—light exposure can harm the RPE and therefore plausibly raise AMD risk, but UV-induced RPE edema as the definitive mediating mechanism is not demonstrated here.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD produces retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction and sub‑RPE lipid deposits that contribute to central vision loss; significant loss of retinal input from such disease can trigger visual hallucinations (Charles Bonnet syndrome). In short, wet AMD can lead to hallucinations indirectly via RPE damage and resultant vision loss, rather than the lipid deposits themselves directly causing hallucinations.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does hyperlipidemia contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"The supplied information links hyperlipidemia to development of age-related macular degeneration and shows that AMD alters retinal pigment epithelial proliferation and can cause RPE loss, but it does not support a direct pathway in which hyperlipidemia induces regenerative proliferation of the retinal pigment epithelium; regeneration is instead associated with therapeutic strategies like stem cell and tissue-engineering approaches.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking increase AMD severity by promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Smoking is strongly linked to increased risk and more severe, advanced AMD, while lipid-rich sub‑retinal pigment epithelial deposits (including oxidized lipids and cholesterol carriers) drive AMD progression; smoking promotes RPE structural and pro‑oxidative/inflammatory changes that can favor lipid accumulation, so it plausibly increases AMD severity at least partly by promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD impair reading by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"No — the atrophic (dry) form of age-related macular degeneration impairs reading by causing degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and central vision loss, leading to reading difficulty, but retinal hemorrhages are a feature of the exudative/neovascular (wet) form rather than dry AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT detect early AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Spectral-domain OCT can detect early AMD by visualizing drusen, outer retinal thinning and pigment epithelial abnormalities, so it is useful for identifying RPE changes that signal early disease. However, frank RPE scarring and fibrosis more commonly arise from neovascular/exudative AMD and chronic damage, so true scarring is typically a later or advanced finding rather than a reliable sole marker of the earliest stage.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Does diabetes exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"The supplied information does not show a direct link between diabetes and retinal pigment epithelial swelling as a mechanism that worsens AMD. The material highlights that RPE abnormalities (including elevation in neovascular AMD and RPE loss in exudative forms) are central to AMD and drive visual decline, and that AMD can be associated with retinal vascular disease, but diabetes itself is not shown here to cause RPE swelling or directly exacerbate AMD via that pathway.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect color perception by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) AMD, leaky abnormal blood vessels produce retinal and retinal pigment epithelial swelling or elevation, causing RPE dysfunction that disrupts retinal function and can alter color perception as well as central vision, and addressing the edema can influence visual outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"A positive family history is linked to worsened age-related macular degeneration, and AMD characteristically features sub-retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits (drusen) whose accumulation — especially oxidized lipids — aggravates disease.

Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Anti‑VEGF injections are the standard treatment for wet (neovascular) AMD and routinely reduce pathological intraretinal and subretinal fluid and retinal edema, including RPE elevations/edematous changes in many patients, producing anatomical improvement and often better visual acuity, though individual responses vary and some eyes show only partial or no response.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"No — smoking is linked to higher risk and worse progression of age-related macular degeneration, but it is not reported to cause regenerative proliferation of the retinal pigment epithelium; rather, smoking is associated with damage and loss of RPE tissue and thus aggravates AMD-related retinal degeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD increase fall risk by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD can lead to scarring and fibrosis of the retinal pigment epithelium through chronic leakage and hemorrhage from abnormal vessels; this RPE damage produces central vision loss, blurred vision and impaired spatial perception and mobility, which reduce independence and increase the likelihood of falls.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does hyperlipidemia increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"The provided information links hyperlipidemia with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration and shows that AMD involves retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities and retinal edema, but it does not provide direct evidence that hyperlipidemia raises AMD risk specifically by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,False,"AREDS-type nutritional supplements can slow progression of dry AMD and reduce the risk of advancing in appropriately selected patients, but they do not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial scarring or atrophy; scarring and fibrotic tissue loss are the result of chronic or neovascular processes that require reparative or regenerative interventions rather than dietary supplementation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,True,"Yes.

Can obesity increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Evidence links obesity to higher risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration through inflammation, oxidative stress, metabolic and lipid disturbances, and promotion of pathological retinal angiogenesis and neuronal damage. While AMD alters retinal pigment epithelial behavior and RPE dysfunction contributes to vision loss, there is no clear evidence that obesity increases AMD risk by promoting beneficial RPE repair; instead obesity-related processes are more consistent with impaired or maladaptive RPE responses that exacerbate disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial edema alone?,False,"No — dry AMD does not typically convert to wet AMD from retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) edema alone; while RPE edema and degeneration are part of the atrophic spectrum and contribute to vision loss, progression to wet (neovascular) AMD involves growth of abnormal, leaky blood vessels with exudation and RPE elevation or loss, so vascular proliferation and leakage rather than isolated RPE edema drive the transition (and therapies targeting the abnormal vessels reduce edema and exudation).",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy—particularly verteporfin-based or vascular-targeted PDT—is used to treat neovascular (wet) AMD and associated choroidal neovascularization and has been shown to improve hemorrhagic complications, so it can help reduce retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages as part of managing wet AMD.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does UV light exposure worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"Light exposure—particularly blue wavelengths—has been linked to oxidative stress, inflammation, RPE dysfunction and cell loss that can contribute to AMD and photoreceptor damage, and some wet AMD presentations include RPE elevation; however, the information provided does not show a direct causal link between UV exposure and RPE swelling that worsens AMD, and intermittent UV exposure has even been reported to improve cellular phenotype in certain high‑risk AMD RPE cells, so a straightforward claim that UV causes RPE swelling to worsen AMD is not supported.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair night vision by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Yes. Wet (exudative) AMD is associated with lipid accumulation and other structural changes in the retinal pigment epithelium, and those RPE alterations impair RPE function and promote retinal degeneration, leading to visual loss that can include reduced night (scotopic) vision. Exudation, RPE elevation or loss, and subretinal deposits seen in wet AMD can exacerbate RPE dysfunction, making lipid buildup a plausible mechanism for worsened night vision.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does hyperlipidemia increase AMD severity by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Available information associates hyperlipidemia with age-related macular degeneration and shows that AMD involves alterations of the retinal pigment epithelium—such as abnormal proliferation, loss, or elevation—that affect disease severity and vision, but there is no evidence here that hyperlipidemia worsens AMD by triggering retinal pigment epithelial repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Smoking is a well-established risk factor that worsens and accelerates AMD and is linked to structural and vascular injury of the retinal pigment epithelium; AMD commonly presents with retinal/RPE edema, and smoking promotes microvascular dysfunction and RPE damage (including reduced RPE volume) that can contribute to fluid accumulation. Altogether, the evidence supports that smoking can exacerbate AMD in part by promoting RPE edema, so quitting smoking can help reduce progression risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause blind spots by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes—dry (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration is associated with lipid-rich subretinal pigment epithelial deposits (drusen) and loss/dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium, changes that damage central retinal cells and lead to blind spots and central vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,True,"Yes — optical coherence tomography is a key tool for diagnosing wet (neovascular) AMD by revealing macular neovascularization, subretinal or intraretinal fluid and retinal pigment epithelium changes, and OCT angiography can directly visualize abnormal choroidal/retinal vessels; retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages are a recognized feature of neovascular AMD, but frank hemorrhages are often best confirmed with clinical fundus imaging or angiography while OCT primarily demonstrates the associated structural changes rather than serving as the sole sensitive detector of superficial RPE hemorrhage.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"The data link diabetes to an increased risk of AMD and clearly link diabetes to diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema, while AMD is associated with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) pathology and can present with retinal edema; however, there is no direct evidence here that diabetes specifically causes RPE edema that then precipitates AMD, so diabetes may raise AMD risk via vascular and retinal damage broadly, but RPE edema as the explicit mediating mechanism is not supported.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect reading speed by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. In wet (neovascular) AMD, chronic leakage and hemorrhage from the choroidal neovascular lesion can lead to scarring that involves the retinal pigment epithelium and macula, producing RPE damage and central visual loss; those changes worsen visual outcomes and reliably reduce reading speed and make reading more difficult.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"A family history of AMD is associated with increased risk and greater severity of the disease, and AMD can produce retinal pigment epithelium changes including proliferation, elevation and exudative/swelling features (particularly in neovascular/exudative forms). Thus family history can indirectly contribute to RPE swelling by promoting or worsening AMD, but there is no indication here that family history directly causes RPE swelling independent of the disease process.",True,False,True,False,Negative
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Anti-VEGF therapy clearly benefits wet (neovascular) AMD by treating choroidal neovascularization, reducing fluid, and improving visual and anatomic outcomes, but there is no evidence here that its benefit stems from lowering lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium; RPE lipid buildup is implicated in AMD and is targeted by other interventions, yet reducing RPE lipid has not been established as the mechanism for anti-VEGF efficacy.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does smoking increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"Smoking is clearly linked to higher risk and worse progression of age-related macular degeneration, and AMD can involve retinal and retinal pigment epithelium changes such as edema or elevation; however, the available evidence does not demonstrate that smoking increases AMD risk specifically by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema—smoking is associated with RPE structural changes and worsened AMD overall, but a direct causal pathway via RPE edema is not established.",False,True,False,True,Positive
Does smoking increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Smoking is associated with increased risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration, including advanced neovascular forms that cause retinal pigment epithelium disruption and scarring; smoking-related RPE loss and alterations in inflammatory and tissue-remodeling factors can promote fibrosis, so smoking likely contributes to AMD-related RPE scarring and worse visual outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to excessive dietary protein intake alone?,False,"No—there is no indication in the provided information that excessive dietary protein alone causes dry AMD to convert to wet (neovascular) AMD. The material shows that diet can influence AMD and that wet AMD involves neovascular changes, but it does not link high protein intake by itself to progression from dry to wet disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does family history elevate AMD risk by increasing retinal pigment epithelial susceptibility to lipid deposits?,True,"Family history does increase risk for age-related macular degeneration, and AMD is characterized by lipid-rich drusen/subretinal deposits and retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction, but the information provided does not directly demonstrate that familial risk specifically increases RPE susceptibility to lipid deposition—so the mechanism is plausible but not confirmed here.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,False,"Anti-VEGF intravitreal injections are an established and effective therapy for wet (neovascular) AMD, reducing abnormal vessel growth, fluid, and improving visual outcomes, but they are not shown to reverse lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium; RPE lipid buildup is implicated in AMD pathogenesis and would likely require lipid-targeted or RPE-directed strategies rather than anti-VEGF treatment alone.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does systemic inflammation worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Systemic inflammation is implicated in worsening AMD through promoting inflammation and tissue damage, but there is no indication here that it exacerbates AMD by triggering retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; alterations in RPE proliferation are associated with AMD itself and RPE dysfunction drives vision loss, while regeneration is discussed more as a reparative or therapeutic process rather than a mechanism by which systemic inflammation worsens the disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can the Amsler grid detect wet AMD by measuring retinal pigment epithelial lipid changes?,False,"No — the Amsler grid is a subjective screening tool that can reveal metamorphopsia or central scotomas and may flag possible wet AMD, but it cannot measure retinal pigment epithelial lipid changes; detecting RPE structural or biochemical alterations and confirming exudative/neovascular disease requires clinical examination and imaging such as OCT/OCT‑A and fundus evaluation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does UV light exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"Light exposure, especially high-energy blue/UV light, can damage retinal pigment epithelium cells through oxidative stress, cell death and functional impairment and thereby contribute to AMD development or progression; however, the evidence does not support UV exposure as a cause of retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages—hemorrhages in the retina are more characteristically linked to neovascular (exudative) AMD, vascular diseases, or other ocular/ systemic risk factors rather than direct UV-induced RPE bleeding.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by repairing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,False,"AREDS-type vitamin/nutritional supplementation can slow progression of intermediate dry age-related macular degeneration and reduce the risk of severe vision loss in appropriate patients, but it does not appear to repair or clear retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits (drusen). Drusen and oxidized lipid accumulation driven by impaired RPE clearance contribute to atrophic change, and while antioxidants and micronutrients may modulate disease progression and outcomes, they do not reverse established RPE lipid deposits; benefits depend on disease stage and patient factors, and some formulations may influence neovascular risk.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does obesity exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Obesity is linked to greater risk, severity, and progression to late/neovascular AMD and promotes inflammation, oxidative stress, pathological angiogenesis, and microvascular aging—processes that drive neovascularization and chronic CNV leakage/hemorrhage, which in turn cause retinal pigment epithelial damage and scarring. Therefore obesity likely exacerbates AMD at least in part by promoting the pathways that lead to RPE scarring, even if scarring itself is usually mediated through neovascular and chronic disease mechanisms.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,True,"Yes. The neovascular (wet/exudative) form of AMD involves abnormal choroidal vessels that can bleed into and beneath the retina, including the retinal pigment epithelium and the submacular space; such hemorrhages, especially submacular hemorrhage, can produce a sudden and often severe drop in central vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,True,"OCT is a well-established tool for diagnosing wet AMD by visualizing retinal layers, fluid, RPE changes and macular neovascularization, and OCT angiography further improves detection of choroidal and choriocapillaris vascular changes; however, it does not directly measure retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia—rather, it reveals structural and vascular signs (neovascularization, exudation, RPE elevation or loss) that are consistent with hypoxia-driven pathology but cannot itself confirm tissue hypoxia.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does smoking worsen dry AMD by promoting retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Smoking is linked to higher risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration and to adverse macular and RPE changes, including reduced RPE volume and dysfunction. Dry AMD features RPE dysfunction, tight‑junction disruption, drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments and can be associated with retinal edema. Taken together, the evidence supports that smoking can worsen dry AMD and may promote RPE alterations that increase the likelihood of edema, though a direct, exclusive causal pathway from smoking to RPE edema is less definitively established.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,False,"No — while photodynamic therapy can be used to treat the neovascular component of wet AMD by targeting abnormal blood vessels, it does not reverse the sub‑retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits (drusen) that contribute to RPE dysfunction; those deposits and oxidized lipids drive disease progression and are not removed by PDT, and approaches aimed at RPE replacement or reparative cell therapies would be the strategies more likely to address RPE degeneration rather than photodynamic treatment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does a diet high in leafy greens reduce AMD progression by eliminating retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia?,False,"Diets rich in leafy greens are linked to lower risk and slower progression of AMD, likely by supplying carotenoids, vitamins and antioxidants that support macular pigment and retinal health, and nutritional supplementation can influence AMD progression; however, there is no evidence that such diets work by eliminating retinal pigment epithelial hypoxia—retinal hypoxia is associated with abnormal vessel growth and permeability, and a direct effect of leafy-green–rich diets on RPE hypoxia has not been established.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD lead to legal blindness by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration can progress to legal blindness, but this happens because abnormal blood vessels, exudation and retinal pigment epithelial damage or loss lead to photoreceptor death and central vision loss—not because the disease causes retinal pigment epithelial repair; repair or replacement of the retinal pigment epithelium is a therapeutic goal to prevent or reduce vision loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does systemic inflammation increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Systemic inflammation is associated with higher AMD risk—acute‑phase markers like elevated serum CRP and chronic inflammatory states promote tissue damage—and lipid accumulation in the retina, particularly within the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), is a central feature of AMD. Given the role of RPE dysfunction and lipid buildup in disease progression, chronic systemic inflammation plausibly contributes to RPE lipid accumulation and thus increases AMD risk, although direct causal proof that systemic inflammation specifically drives RPE lipid loading remains limited.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD transition to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Dry (atrophic) AMD can progress to wet (neovascular) AMD, but retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) scarring is most often a consequence of neovascular activity rather than the primary trigger. Choroidal neovascularization with ongoing leakage and hemorrhage leads to fibrosis and RPE scarring and worsened vision; RPE degeneration and other RPE changes can accompany or precede neovascularization, but scarring alone is not typically the initiating event that converts dry AMD into wet AMD.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Does AMD impair color perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration is marked by sub‑retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits and related RPE degeneration; loss or dysfunction of the RPE and overlying macular photoreceptors leads to central visual impairment and can disrupt cone function, so color perception is often impaired as a consequence of these deposits and ensuing retinal damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,True,"Yes. Anti-VEGF therapy is the standard treatment for wet (neovascular) AMD and by suppressing abnormal neovascular growth it reduces exudation and bleeding from choroidal neovascular membranes, which often lessens retinal pigment epithelial–associated hemorrhages and helps stabilize anatomy and vision in many patients. Responses vary, however: some eyes show only partial or no response and long-term outcomes can differ, and intravitreal injections carry their own risks, including rarely causing hemorrhagic complications.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"Family history does increase the risk of age-related macular degeneration, but it is not shown to directly cause retinal pigment epithelial edema; rather, genetic predisposition raises the likelihood of developing AMD, and certain AMD subtypes—especially neovascular/exudative forms—can produce retinal pigment epithelium alterations and retinal edema secondary to leaky, exudative processes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause distorted vision by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet/exudative) AMD commonly causes distorted vision, and the condition is linked to lipid buildup and other changes in the retinal pigment epithelium; these RPE alterations and exudative processes can impair RPE function and lead to the visual distortion seen in wet AMD.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does dry AMD progress slowly because it avoids retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"The available evidence does not support the claim that dry (atrophic) AMD progresses slowly because it avoids retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair. Dry AMD is marked by progressive RPE degeneration and geographic atrophy and generally advances more slowly than neovascular (wet) AMD primarily because it lacks the exudation and destructive neovascularization that drive rapid vision loss. RPE dysfunction and loss are central to disease and are targets for reparative therapies, but there is no specific indication here that slower progression is due to avoidance of RPE lipid repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can systemic inflammation exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Systemic inflammation is linked to AMD and can amplify destructive inflammatory signaling and vascular leakage that underlie retinal edema; inflammatory mediators and inflammasome activity are found in the RPE, and systemic inflammatory states can therefore promote RPE swelling and worsen AMD with attendant vision decline.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to higher risk and progression of AMD, including late/neovascular forms that produce scarring, and it negatively affects the retinal pigment epithelium (altering its volume and integrity), so it likely contributes to RPE-related scarring and fibrosis and thereby worsens AMD and visual outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can OCT detect early dry AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,True,"Spectral-domain OCT reliably detects early dry AMD by showing drusen, RPE dysfunction/atrophy and outer retinal thinning, but true hemorrhage at the RPE is uncommon in early dry AMD and is more typical of neovascular or other vascular retinal disease; OCT can visualize hemorrhagic material, but its presence should prompt evaluation for neovascularization or alternative causes rather than being taken as a sign of uncomplicated early dry AMD.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does wet AMD treatment with anti-VEGF injections work by reversing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,False,"No — anti‑VEGF injections treat wet (neovascular) AMD by suppressing abnormal vessel growth and leakage, reducing fluid and exudation and often improving or stabilizing vision, but they do not reverse established retinal pigment epithelial scarring or fibrosis, which is largely irreversible and driven by chronic CNV leakage, hemorrhage, and RPE loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can diabetes contribute to AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Vascular disease like diabetes can promote leaky retinal vessels and retinal edema, and edema involving the retinal pigment epithelium—including RPE elevation or dysfunction—is linked to AMD progression and worse visual outcomes, so diabetic microvascular damage could plausibly increase RPE edema and thereby exacerbate AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,False,"No — dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can progress to geographic atrophy, but this progression reflects degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors (nascent GA changes, drusen-associated damage and declining autofluorescence), rather than primary RPE swelling; RPE elevation or swelling is more typically linked to neovascular/exudative disease, while geographic atrophy is defined by RPE and photoreceptor loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase fall risk by impairing retinal pigment epithelial lipid metabolism?,True,"Yes—dysfunctional lipid metabolism in the retinal pigment epithelium can contribute to AMD, and AMD produces central vision loss, poor spatial perception and gait changes that increase fall risk, so impaired RPE lipid handling is a plausible pathway linking retinal disease to higher risk of falls.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does UV exposure accelerate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"The associations indicate that sunlight/UV exposure is linked to age-related ocular disease and earlier AMD while AMD itself is characterized by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) degeneration and loss; RPE regeneration is discussed as a therapeutic goal (for example via stem-cell or tissue-engineering approaches) rather than a mechanism by which UV would worsen disease. Although some cell-model findings hint that intermittent UV can improve certain high‑risk AMD RPE cell phenotypes, there is no clear support that UV accelerates AMD by inducing RPE regeneration—instead UV is more plausibly implicated in ocular damage that can promote AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Yes. The neovascular (wet) form of AMD can cause rapid, often irreversible central vision loss through choroidal neovascularization, exudation and hemorrhage that damage the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors; RPE atrophy is a feature of AMD and contributes to vision loss, so wet AMD can induce or accelerate RPE atrophy and thereby worsen vision quickly.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does a diet high in antioxidants prevent AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"Antioxidant-rich diets are linked to lower risk and can help slow or improve age-related macular degeneration by reducing oxidative stress and supporting retinal health, but there is no indication here that they reverse retinal pigment epithelial edema; edema in AMD is more directly related to neovascular activity and is typically managed with targeted therapies such as anti-VEGF treatment rather than diet alone.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate wet AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Smoking is linked to increased risk and progression of AMD, including neovascular/wet forms, and AMD is characterized by subretinal/retinal pigment epithelial lipid and oxidized lipid deposits that aggravate the disease; because smoking promotes inflammatory and degenerative changes tied to RPE dysfunction, it can plausibly increase RPE lipid/oxidative deposits and thereby worsen wet AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD affect depth perception by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"Dry (atrophic) AMD primarily involves degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium and central vision loss that can reduce spatial and depth perception and impair reading, driving, and mobility; swelling or edema of the retinal pigment epithelium is not a typical feature of dry AMD and is more characteristic of neovascular (wet) AMD driven by leaky blood vessels.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does obesity increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Obesity is associated with a higher risk of and worse progression in age-related macular degeneration, including late and neovascular forms, but there is no evidence here that obesity increases AMD risk by inducing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration; RPE proliferation/regeneration is linked to AMD biology, yet the provided information does not support RPE regeneration as the mediating mechanism from obesity to increased AMD risk.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair reading by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age‑related macular degeneration is associated with lipid‑rich subretinal pigment epithelial deposits and RPE elevation or loss; these RPE changes disrupt central retinal function and lead to blurred or lost central vision, which commonly produces difficulty reading.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does systemic inflammation contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"Systemic inflammation is implicated in AMD and appears to promote disease onset and tissue-damaging processes rather than driving retinal pigment epithelium repair; AMD itself alters RPE proliferation and RPE loss is a feature, while reparative RPE approaches are therapeutic interventions rather than a shown consequence of systemic inflammation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements reduce AMD progression by reversing retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages?,False,"AREDS formulations are documented to slow progression of age‑related macular degeneration in the appropriate stages and can improve quality‑adjusted life years, especially for intermediate or high‑risk dry AMD; however, retinal pigment epithelial hemorrhages are most often a feature of wet (neovascular) disease or other vascular/ocular conditions, and there is no indication here that AREDS supplements reverse or directly resolve those hemorrhages—they help modify AMD progression but do not substitute for treatments that target bleeding or neovascular activity.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause blind spots by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD is clearly linked to central vision loss and blind spots through damage, loss or displacement of the retinal pigment epithelium together with exudation and photoreceptor injury; the provided evidence points to RPE dysfunction and degeneration as the cause of scotomas rather than an adaptive RPE ""lipid repair"" process producing blind spots.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can family history increase AMD risk by predisposing to retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. A family history that increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration can indirectly predispose to retinal pigment epithelial scarring because familial risk raises the chance of developing neovascular (exudative) AMD, and the bleeding, leakage and RPE disruption that occur in neovascular disease commonly lead to RPE damage, scarring and fibrosis that worsen visual outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial regeneration alone?,False,"No — progression from dry (atrophic) AMD to wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD is not driven solely by retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) regeneration; RPE loss or dysfunction is a key part of the disease, but the conversion to wet AMD requires additional processes such as abnormal choroidal neovascularization, vascular leakage and inflammatory/angiogenic signaling. RPE-focused interventions (cell replacement or regenerative approaches) target one important component but do not by themselves fully explain or inevitably cause the switch to neovascular disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Anti-VEGF injections are effective for treating wet (neovascular/exudative) age-related macular degeneration by reducing fluid and disease activity and improving visual acuity, but the provided information does not support that they reduce retinal pigment epithelial atrophy; other approaches such as retinal pigment epithelium cell transplantation or growth-factor–based strategies are those noted for targeting RPE degeneration.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does UV light increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"UV exposure is linked to ocular disease and early age-related macular degeneration and the retinal pigment epithelium is central to AMD, but there is no evidence here that UV increases AMD risk by promoting lipid repair in the retinal pigment epithelium. Some data even suggest intermittent UV exposure can improve certain RPE cell phenotypes, so UV’s effects are complex; if UV raises AMD risk it is more likely through damaging pathways rather than by inducing beneficial lipid repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect face recognition by inducing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration can lead to retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy, producing central visual loss and other vision impairments that reduce face-recognition ability, with advanced AMD particularly associated with deficits in recognizing faces.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does systemic inflammation worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,True,"Systemic inflammation is linked to AMD and to retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) pathology: inflammatory mediators are found in AMD and in RPE, systemic inflammation promotes tissue damage and is associated with intermediate and advanced disease, and certain AMD forms show RPE elevation; together this supports that systemic inflammation can worsen AMD by driving RPE inflammation and swelling or dysfunction, though direct proof of a single causal pathway is limited.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause gradual vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. The dry (atrophic) form of AMD is associated with subretinal/retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits (drusen) and oxidized lipids, and progressive RPE dysfunction and atrophy beneath the macula leads to gradual loss of central vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can OCT confirm wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"OCT can show retinal pigment epithelial changes tied to lipid accumulation—such as drusen, subretinal deposits, RPE elevation, hyperreflective foci and associated exudation—that are seen in AMD, but finding lipid accumulation alone on OCT does not by itself confirm wet (neovascular) AMD; confirmation typically requires evidence of neovascularization or active exudation, often aided by OCT angiography or clinical angiography.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does diabetes increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Diabetes is linked to a higher likelihood of developing or aggravating age-related macular degeneration through retinal and choroidal vascular and metabolic disturbances, accumulation of advanced glycation end products, and associated retinal disease, and retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction is central to AMD pathology; however, there is no indication here that diabetes increases AMD risk specifically by driving retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision changes by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) AMD, leaky or bleeding abnormal blood vessels beneath the macula can lead to scarring and fibrosis that involve the retinal pigment epithelium, and acute events such as submacular hemorrhage or rapid fibrotic change can produce sudden deterioration or changes in central vision because damage or loss of the retinal pigment epithelium substantially worsens visual outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history elevate AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Family history is clearly associated with an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration, and AMD is linked to multiple alterations in the retinal pigment epithelium; however, there is no direct indication here that familial risk operates by triggering retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair, so the specific mechanism you propose is not supported by the provided information.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy stabilize wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Anti‑VEGF therapy effectively stabilizes wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD by suppressing neovascular activity, reducing exudation and subretinal fluid, and improving visual outcomes, but there is no indication that it reduces retinal pigment epithelial lipid or sub‑RPE/oxidized lipid deposits; those lipid accumulations are implicated in AMD pathogenesis and are addressed by other strategies rather than VEGF blockade.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does smoking increase dry AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Smoking does increase the risk of dry age-related macular degeneration, but the evidence points to harmful effects on the retinal pigment epithelium—reduced RPE volume, dysfunction, atrophy and related degenerative changes—rather than any RPE lipid-repair process as the reason for the increased risk.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair driving by inducing retinal pigment epithelial atrophy?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD can progress to retinal pigment epithelial atrophy or geographic atrophy with central vision loss, and those macular changes are linked to reduced driving ability, poorer driving performance, increased driving errors and greater difficulty and safety risk when driving.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does systemic inflammation exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial regeneration?,False,"Systemic inflammation is associated with worse age-related macular degeneration by driving tissue destruction and inflammatory changes that damage and dysregulate the retinal pigment epithelium, leading to RPE loss and poorer visual outcomes. RPE regeneration is described in the context of targeted reparative strategies like stem-cell therapies and tissue engineering rather than as a consequence of systemic inflammation, so systemic inflammation appears to exacerbate AMD through injury and dysregulation of the RPE, not by promoting its regeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements mitigate AMD risk by reversing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,False,"AREDS-style vitamin and antioxidant supplements can reduce the risk of progression in age-related macular degeneration, particularly for intermediate or dry forms, but there is no indication they clear or reverse subretinal/retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits; their benefit is in slowing disease progression and reducing risk rather than removing existing lipid accumulations that contribute to worsening AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause depth perception issues by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD involves retinal pigment epithelium damage (elevation, loss and macular dysfunction) and produces central vision loss, blurred vision and impaired spatial perception that can include reduced depth perception; the information provided attributes depth and spatial deficits to macular/RPE damage and exudation rather than to an RPE “lipid repair” process, so there’s no support here that depth perception problems are caused by induction of RPE lipid repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity worsen AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Yes. Obesity is linked to higher risk and worse progression of age‑related macular degeneration, and because obesity alters lipid metabolism and promotes inflammation and oxidative stress while AMD is characterized by lipid accumulation in the retinal pigment epithelium, obesity-driven dyslipidemia and inflammatory/oxidative pathways are likely to increase RPE lipid deposition and thereby exacerbate AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy due to retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Dry (non‑neovascular) AMD can progress to geographic atrophy, a late stage marked by loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors with consequent central vision loss; retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction is implicated in that progression, but there is no indication here that RPE lipid repair specifically drives the transition to geographic atrophy.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Wet AMD is characterized by choroidal neovascularization with retinal edema and involvement of the retinal pigment epithelium, and available therapies—especially intravitreal anti‑VEGF agents—are linked to reduction of retinal edema and improved visual outcomes; however, the information provided does not indicate that photodynamic therapy specifically reduces retinal pigment epithelial edema, so its effectiveness for that particular effect is not supported or is unclear from these data.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does UV light exposure increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration?,False,"The supplied information links light—particularly blue light—to RPE damage (oxidative stress, cell death, lipofuscin accumulation and functional impairment) and to dry AMD, but it does not show that UV exposure causes retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration that increases AMD risk; indeed, intermittent UV exposure is even reported to improve some high‑risk RPE cell phenotypes, so the materials do not support that specific mechanism.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause visual hallucinations by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD often produces exudation with retinal and retinal pigment epithelial edema or elevation that impairs macular function and causes central vision loss; that loss and retinal deafferentation can in turn provoke visual hallucinations such as Charles Bonnet syndrome, so wet AMD can indirectly lead to hallucinations via RPE/retinal damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does systemic inflammation contribute to AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Systemic inflammation is implicated in AMD and can drive disease onset and progression via circulating inflammatory mediators and tissue-damaging processes, with markers like CRP and cytokines observed in AMD; however, the evidence here points to RPE dysfunction, loss, and inflammatory activation rather than to inflammation‑driven retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair, so systemic inflammation appears to worsen RPE damage and AMD rather than induce a protective lipid‑repair response.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking increase AMD severity by promoting retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Smoking is strongly associated with increased severity and progression of AMD, including neovascular forms that feature retinal pigment epithelium abnormalities and retinal edema; smoking-related microvascular damage and reductions in RPE volume provide plausible pathways by which smoking could promote RPE edema and thereby worsen AMD, although a direct causal link specifically proving smoking induces RPE edema is not explicitly established here.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD impair reading by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Dry (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration impairs reading mainly through damage and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and resultant central vision decline, causing difficulty with reading; the information provided links reading problems to RPE degeneration and visual impairment and does not support the idea that dry AMD impairs reading by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT detect early AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. High-resolution spectral-domain OCT can identify early AMD by visualizing retinal pigment epithelial changes—such as focal edema or elevation—along with outer retinal thinning and drusen-related abnormalities, and these OCT-detected RPE and retinal edema features support diagnosis of early disease and correlate with early visual decline.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does diabetes exacerbate AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration?,False,"The provided information does not support the specific claim that diabetes exacerbates AMD by driving lipid regeneration in the retinal pigment epithelium; the data link AMD with RPE dysfunction, lipid-rich deposits, systemic inflammatory and vascular influences, and vision loss from RPE damage, but there is no direct evidence here tying diabetes to RPE lipid regeneration as the mechanism—further targeted evidence would be required to establish that connection.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD affect color perception by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet/exudative) age‑related macular degeneration is associated with lipid‑rich subretinal and sub‑retinal pigment epithelial deposits as well as RPE elevation or loss; these structural and biochemical changes in the RPE and macula impair retinal function and can produce central visual deficits, including altered color perception.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does family history worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"Family history is associated with increased risk and worsening of age-related macular degeneration, and AMD can present with retinal edema and various retinal pigment epithelial changes (elevation, loss or proliferation) in its exudative/neovascular forms. The evidence here does not show a direct causal link from family history to retinal pigment epithelial edema; instead family history appears to exacerbate AMD, and the disease process can then lead to RPE edema.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF therapy improve wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Anti-VEGF therapy is effective for wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD by suppressing abnormal vessel growth and reducing leakage, hemorrhage, and subretinal fluid, which improves anatomical and visual outcomes; by limiting the ongoing leakage and bleeding that drive scar formation, it can slow or reduce progression of retinal pigment epithelial scarring and its visual consequences, though it generally cannot reverse established scar tissue and some patients show partial or no response with variable long-term effectiveness.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does smoking worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration?,False,"Smoking is a well-established risk factor that worsens the occurrence and progression of age-related macular degeneration and is linked to RPE changes and worse visual outcomes; however, the available information associates smoking with RPE loss or dysfunction rather than promoting retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration, so there’s no support here that RPE lipid regeneration is the mechanism by which smoking aggravates AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD increase fall risk by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) AMD is associated with subretinal/retinal pigment epithelial lipid deposits and RPE damage, which contribute to central and overall visual impairment; that loss of central vision and reduced spatial perception and mobility increases dependence and functional errors that raise the risk of falls.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does systemic inflammation increase AMD risk by causing retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,True,"The evidence links systemic inflammation and inflammatory markers to higher AMD risk and shows inflammatory mediators present in and affecting the retinal pigment epithelium, while AMD features include RPE elevation, loss, and dysfunction; however, the available information does not demonstrate a direct causal pathway in which systemic inflammation specifically produces RPE swelling as the mechanism increasing AMD risk.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD by reversing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"AREDS-style vitamin/nutritional supplements are supported for slowing progression of intermediate and certain dry forms of age-related macular degeneration and reducing risk of advanced disease, but there is no evidence they reverse retinal pigment epithelial edema; RPE edema in AMD is linked to vascular/leakage processes and is managed with other targeted treatments such as intravitreal therapy rather than AREDS supplements.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause rapid vision loss by inducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration?,False,"Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD is a cause of rapid, often central, vision loss, but the information provided links that loss to choroidal neovascularization, exudation, retinal pigment epithelium disruption (elevation or loss) and secondary photoreceptor degeneration rather than to any process described as retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can obesity increase AMD risk by promoting retinal pigment epithelial edema?,True,"Yes. Obesity is associated with higher risk and progression of age-related macular degeneration and promotes inflammation, oxidative stress, microvascular dysfunction and pathological retinal angiogenesis that affect the retina; those processes are implicated in exudation and retinal pigment epithelial changes (including elevation/edema) seen in neovascular and late AMD, so obesity can plausibly contribute indirectly to RPE edema and thereby increase AMD risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD progress to wet AMD due to retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration alone?,False,"No — progression from dry to wet AMD is not caused by retinal pigment epithelial lipid regeneration alone; RPE changes and lipid-rich deposits play a role, but conversion requires neovascular processes and RPE loss and is influenced by inflammatory, vascular, and systemic factors, so multiple interacting mechanisms rather than a single RPE lipid event drive the shift.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy manage wet AMD by reducing retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation?,True,"Photodynamic therapy (including verteporfin and vascular-targeted approaches) is an established treatment for wet/neovascular AMD by targeting abnormal choroidal vessels and improving visual outcomes, but the information provided links AMD and retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation without indicating that photodynamic therapy reduces RPE lipid buildup; therefore PDT can help manage wet AMD, but there’s no evidence here that it does so by lowering retinal pigment epithelial lipid accumulation.",False,False,False,False,No Help
Does UV light exposure worsen AMD by causing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"There is no clear support that UV exposure worsens AMD by triggering retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair; while light—particularly blue light—has been linked to RPE damage (oxidative stress, cell death, lipofuscin buildup, impaired RPE functions) and to AMD onset or progression, intermittent UV exposure has been reported to improve cellular and functional phenotypes in some high‑risk AMD RPE cell models, and a worsening mechanism specifically via RPE lipid repair is not described.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD impair night vision by inducing retinal pigment epithelial scarring?,True,"Yes. Neovascular (wet) AMD causes leaking and bleeding from abnormal vessels that often lead to retinal pigment epithelium damage and scarring/fibrosis; RPE loss and scarring disrupt retinal function and produce visual impairment, so although wet AMD most prominently affects central vision, RPE scarring can also contribute to problems with low‑light or night vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does systemic inflammation increase AMD severity by causing retinal pigment epithelial repair?,False,"The available evidence indicates systemic inflammation is linked to worse AMD and to tissue-damaging inflammatory processes, while retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) changes occur during AMD (including RPE proliferation and loss) and influence disease severity and vision; there is no indication that systemic inflammation promotes beneficial RPE repair—instead it appears to exacerbate degeneration and poorer visual outcomes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking exacerbate AMD by increasing retinal pigment epithelial lipid repair?,False,"Smoking is a well-established risk factor that increases the likelihood, earlier onset, and progression of age-related macular degeneration and is associated with damage and dysfunction of the retinal pigment epithelium; there is no evidence that smoking exacerbates AMD by enhancing RPE lipid-repair—if anything, smoking is linked to RPE loss and pro‑degenerative changes that worsen AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause blind spots by inducing retinal pigment epithelial edema?,False,"No — in the dry (atrophic) form of AMD blind spots result from degeneration and loss of the retinal pigment epithelium and overlying photoreceptors, causing central vision loss; RPE edema is more typical of neovascular (wet) AMD driven by leaky vessels and exudation, so blind spots in dry AMD are due to atrophy rather than RPE edema.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can OCT diagnose wet AMD by detecting retinal pigment epithelial swelling?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography can visualize retinal layers and detect retinal pigment epithelial swelling or elevation along with macular fluid and other signs of exudation; because wet (neovascular) AMD commonly produces RPE elevation associated with choroidal neovascularization, OCT is widely used to diagnose and monitor wet AMD, and OCT angiography can further improve detection of the underlying neovascular membrane—but RPE swelling alone should be interpreted with other OCT findings for a definitive diagnosis.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
"Does smoking increase oxidative stress in the retina, making AMD more likely?",True,"Smoking is a well-established risk factor that increases the likelihood and severity of age-related macular degeneration, and oxidative stress is present in the retina and known to drive AMD pathogenesis and progression; taken together, the evidence supports that smoking promotes retinal oxidative stress, thereby making AMD more likely.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
"Can wet AMD cause blood vessel leakage, leading to complete vision restoration?",False,"Yes — the wet (neovascular) form of age-related macular degeneration involves abnormal new blood vessels under the macula that leak fluid and blood (exudation), causing central and progressive vision loss rather than restoration. Such leakage typically damages central vision and can lead to permanent impairment or blindness; treatments can reduce leakage and sometimes improve or stabilize vision, but complete restoration is generally not achievable.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
"Does aging lead to drusen buildup, which always progresses to wet AMD?",False,"Aging is a major driver of macular changes and is associated with the formation and accumulation of drusen and with degeneration of retinal pigment cells; drusen are common in early and intermediate AMD and increase the risk of progression to advanced, sight‑threatening forms (including neovascular/wet AMD) but do not inevitably lead to wet AMD—many people with drusen remain in non‑neovascular stages and progression depends on additional risk factors and disease processes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
"Can anti-VEGF injections reduce fluid in wet AMD, improving central vision over time?",True,"Yes. Intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are the standard treatment for neovascular (wet) AMD and typically reduce subretinal and intraretinal fluid, lower central retinal thickness, and lead to stabilization or improvement in central and best‑corrected visual acuity over time. Treatments such as ranibizumab, aflibercept and bevacizumab can control disease activity, though some eyes have persistent or recalcitrant fluid and many patients need ongoing injections; there are also potential risks (including raised intraocular pressure and injection‑related complications) and treatment‑burden and cost considerations.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
"Does UV exposure damage the retinal pigment epithelium, causing immediate AMD onset?",False,"While ultraviolet light can harm the eye and has been linked to age-related ocular disease and earlier signs of macular degeneration, damage to the retinal pigment epithelium from UV is generally a cumulative, contributory factor rather than a direct trigger of immediate AMD onset; AMD arises from multifactorial, progressive RPE dysfunction and cell loss influenced by aging, genetics, and other risk factors, so UV exposure may increase risk or aggravate progression over time but does not typically cause sudden onset of the disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
