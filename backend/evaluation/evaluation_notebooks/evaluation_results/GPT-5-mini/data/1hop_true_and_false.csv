Does AMD primarily affect the macula of the retina?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration mainly targets the macula—the central part of the retina responsible for sharp central vision—leading to central vision loss, blurred vision and difficulties with reading and driving, with dry and neovascular (wet) forms that can progress to severe or irreversible vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is wet AMD characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth?,True,"Yes. Wet AMD (also called neovascular or exudative AMD) is defined by abnormal growth of blood vessels beneath the retina (choroidal neovascularization) that causes leakage and exudation, often leading to rapid central vision loss; treatments typically target this pathological vessel growth with anti‑VEGF therapies.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can dry AMD lead to complete blindness?,False,"Dry (atrophic) AMD can cause progressive, often irreversible central vision loss and, when it advances to extensive geographic atrophy with photoreceptor loss, may lead to legal or profound blindness; complete loss of all vision is uncommon because peripheral retina is typically spared.",False,True,False,True,Positive
Is smoking a known risk factor for AMD?,True,"Yes. Smoking is a well-established, modifiable risk factor for age-related macular degeneration: smokers have a higher risk of developing AMD, are more likely to progress to advanced or late stages (including neovascular disease and geographic atrophy), and tend to have worse outcomes, while cessation reduces risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD progress faster than dry AMD?,True,"Yes. The neovascular or ""wet"" form, marked by abnormal new vessel growth and exudation, typically produces more sudden and faster central vision loss and a higher risk of severe or irreversible impairment than the non‑neovascular ""dry"" form, which usually progresses more slowly through atrophic changes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is there a cure for advanced dry AMD?,False,"There is currently no proven cure for advanced dry age-related macular degeneration, which can cause irreversible vision loss and is difficult to reverse; however, many experimental and supportive approaches aim to slow progression or restore function, including cell-based therapies (stem-cell–derived or induced pluripotent RPE transplants), intravitreal and pharmacologic agents, light- and laser-based treatments, implants or vision-enhancing devices, and other strategies targeting inflammation and RPE dysfunction—ongoing research may provide more effective options in the future.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections treat wet AMD?,True,"Yes. Anti-VEGF injections given into the eye are the standard, effective treatment for wet (neovascular/exudative) age-related macular degeneration: they reduce abnormal blood vessels and retinal fluid, often improving or stabilizing vision and helping prevent severe vision loss. Common agents include ranibizumab, aflibercept, bevacizumab and newer drugs such as faricimab. Therapy typically requires repeated injections and monitoring and can carry costs, treatment burden and rare risks such as sustained intraocular pressure elevation or other injection-related complications.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD affect peripheral vision more than central vision?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration mainly damages the macula and thus impairs central vision—reducing the ability to read, recognize faces, and drive—while peripheral vision is generally spared or remains relatively intact, though advanced or atrophic disease can further reduce visual function.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is family history a risk factor for developing AMD?,True,Yes—having a family history of age-related macular degeneration is an established risk factor: a positive parental or familial history and inherited susceptibility variants (including common genetic changes linked to complement and ARMS2/HTRA1 pathways) are associated with a higher likelihood of developing AMD and can influence its severity.,True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be diagnosed with a blood test?,False,"The provided information indicates that blood tests and blood-based examinations are described as diagnostic tools for age-related macular degeneration, with circulating markers such as inflammatory proteins, retinol and lipid-related profiles noted as relevant; nevertheless, AMD is also identified by retinal signs on clinical eye exams and imaging (fundus photos, OCT), so diagnosis may involve both blood biomarkers and ocular testing.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does the Amsler grid help detect AMD symptoms?,True,"Yes. The Amsler grid (Amsler test) is a simple tool used to detect visual distortions like metamorphopsia and can reveal early or intermediate signs of age-related macular degeneration by highlighting central vision changes such as blurring, distortion, or difficulty reading, making it useful for monitoring AMD symptoms.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is dry AMD more common than wet AMD?,True,"Yes. The dry (atrophic) form is the more common type of age-related macular degeneration, while the less common wet (neovascular) form causes more rapid and severe vision loss and is the primary target of effective anti-VEGF treatments; some dry cases can progress to the wet form.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can sunglasses completely prevent AMD?,False,"Sunglasses that block UV can help protect the eyes and may lower the risk of developing age-related macular degeneration, but they cannot completely prevent it because AMD is driven by multiple factors—aging, genetics, inflammation and other health conditions—so protective eyewear is one useful measure among several rather than a guaranteed prevention.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does diabetes increase the risk of AMD?,True,"Overall evidence indicates that diabetes is associated with a higher risk of age-related macular degeneration: diabetes and diabetes mellitus have been linked to greater occurrence and future development of AMD, likely mediated by vascular and inflammatory changes (including altered choroidal blood flow, shared cardiovascular risk factors, systemic inflammation, and accumulation of advanced glycation end products). Although some studies report inconsistent or opposing findings for early disease, the preponderance of data supports diabetes as a factor that increases AMD risk.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Is laser therapy a standard treatment for dry AMD?,False,"No — conventional laser is established for neovascular (wet) AMD, but it is not a standard treatment for dry (nonexudative) AMD; several investigational light- and subthreshold-laser approaches and devices have been studied and may alter drusen or slow progression in some cases, yet they remain experimental rather than part of routine standard care.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Are drusen deposits associated with dry AMD?,True,"Yes. Drusen are a characteristic feature of dry age-related macular degeneration—patients often develop drusen, including large soft drusen and drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments, which can be associated with progression to geographic atrophy and other retinal changes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD primarily affect people over 50?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration chiefly affects older adults—commonly those over 50—and is much more prevalent in the elderly, with hundreds of millions affected worldwide; it worsens with age and can cause progressive central vision loss, blurred vision and severe visual impairment that impacts reading, driving and daily independence.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause sudden vision loss?,True,"Yes. The neovascular (wet) form of AMD can cause sudden or rapid loss of central vision when abnormal new blood vessels grow and leak or bleed beneath the macula, such as with a submacular hemorrhage; prompt diagnosis and treatments like anti-VEGF injections can help limit damage and sometimes improve vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD contagious between individuals?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is not contagious and cannot be transmitted between people; it is an age-related, degenerative retinal condition that mainly affects older adults and is driven by age, genetics and other noninfectious risk factors, leading to central vision loss and possible blindness rather than spreading like an infection.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does obesity increase the risk of AMD?,True,"Yes. Obesity and higher BMI have been linked to an increased risk of developing age-related macular degeneration and to greater likelihood of late-stage disease; obesity-related inflammation, oxidative stress, altered lipid metabolism and adverse effects on the retina and retinal neurovascular processes are thought to contribute to worsening AMD and vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be reversed with surgery?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is not generally reversible with surgery. While certain surgical and procedural treatments can stabilize or improve vision in specific situations (for example interventions for neovascular/wet AMD, cataract surgery that improves vision, and experimental retinal pigment epithelium transplantation approaches), these do not cure the underlying degenerative process and, in some cases, surgery can worsen or trigger AMD progression; outcomes depend on the AMD subtype and the chosen treatment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect color perception?,True,"Yes. AMD damages the macula and central retina, causing central vision loss and overall visual impairment that commonly degrades color discrimination—colors can appear faded, less distinct, or harder to tell apart—and the extent of color deficits varies with disease severity though some treatments and assistive technologies can partially help.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive screen time?,False,"No—age-related macular degeneration is primarily an age-linked degenerative disease of the macula influenced by aging, genetic and systemic factors and characterized by progressive central vision loss and distinctive retinal changes; current evidence does not point to excessive screen time as a cause.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can optical coherence tomography (OCT) detect AMD?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography, including OCT angiography, reliably detects and characterizes age-related macular degeneration and its subtypes—dry and neovascular—by visualizing retinal layers and microstructure, identifying macular atrophy, neovascular membranes, subretinal and intraretinal fluid, and other biomarkers to aid diagnosis, staging, and treatment decisions.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD involve fluid leakage under the retina?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration involves abnormal new blood vessels beneath the retina that leak fluid (and sometimes blood) under and into the retinal layers, causing blurred or distorted central vision; imaging can detect this fluid and anti‑VEGF injections are used to reduce the leakage and limit vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD more prevalent in women than men?,True,"Age-related macular degeneration affects both men and women, but it is generally more common in women—especially the wet (neovascular) form, which shows a higher proportion of affected women; age and ethnicity further influence risk and prevalence.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be treated with over-the-counter eye drops?,False,"No—age-related macular degeneration affects the macula and causes progressive central vision loss that is not treated by over-the-counter eye drops; effective management involves prescription therapies and clinical procedures (for example anti-VEGF injections and other specialist treatments), while nutritional supplements such as lutein and zeaxanthin may offer supportive benefit; OTC drops can relieve surface problems like dry eye but do not treat the macular disease, so evaluation by an eye specialist is needed.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does high blood pressure increase AMD risk?,True,"Yes. Hypertension is associated with a higher likelihood of developing age-related macular degeneration, likely because high blood pressure can reduce choroidal blood flow and disturb vascular homeostasis in the retina; managing blood pressure may help lower the risk of retinal disease.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD linked to high cholesterol levels?,True,"The evidence is mixed and complex: some findings link higher total cholesterol with a lower risk of age-related macular degeneration and certain genetic variants tied to AMD are associated with improved HDL, while metabolic disturbance and high‑fat, high‑cholesterol diets are tied to abnormal cholesterol and harmful changes that could influence disease processes; in short, cholesterol is implicated but the association with AMD is not a simple direct risk‑increase.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can fish oil supplements alone prevent AMD?,False,"No — while fish‑oil and other marine or dietary oils can influence retinal inflammation and factors linked to macular degeneration and may modestly modify risk, age‑related macular degeneration is multifactorial (driven by age, genetics, systemic inflammation and other risks) and cannot be reliably prevented by a single supplement alone; comprehensive risk reduction and available treatments remain important.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect the optic nerve directly?,False,"The information indicates that age-related macular degeneration primarily affects the macula and retina, causing central vision loss and visual impairment, and does not show a direct effect on the optic nerve; optic nerve damage is attributed to other conditions such as glaucoma or optic neuritis, though AMD may be associated with broader neurodegenerative processes without a clear direct causal impact on the optic nerve.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is photodynamic therapy used to treat wet AMD?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy—notably verteporfin-based and vascular-targeted PDT—has been used to treat the wet (neovascular) form of age-related macular degeneration and related choroidal neovascular conditions; it can be an option for certain subtypes or as part of combination strategies, while intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections remain the primary standard treatment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD increase the risk of falls in older adults?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) commonly causes central and overall visual impairment—blurred vision, loss of spatial perception and motion sensitivity—that reduces mobility, increases dependence and affects tasks like driving, and visual impairment in turn is associated with a higher risk of falls in older adults; accompanying emotional effects and fear of falling can further raise fall risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD only occur in one eye at a time?,False,"No — AMD can affect one eye or both. It may start in a single eye but often involves the other eye over time; dry and neovascular forms, including geographic atrophy, can occur in either or both eyes and lead to central and progressive vision loss, so each eye should be evaluated separately.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AREDS supplements slow dry AMD progression?,True,"Yes—AREDS/AREDS2-style nutritional supplements have been shown to slow progression of dry AMD in people with intermediate or high‑risk (AREDS category 3–4) disease, producing a modest absolute reduction in the risk of severe vision loss; the benefit varies by disease stage and genetic background, does not halt all progression, and formulations carry potential harms (including formulation‑specific cancer or systemic risks and possible effects on neovascular conversion), so use should be targeted to appropriate patients in discussion with their clinician.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD more common in Caucasian populations?,True,Yes. Age-related macular degeneration shows ethnic differences and is generally more common in people of European/Caucasian descent; genetic risk factors and population-specific disease patterns (including different rates of related subtypes) help explain this higher prevalence.,True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD always lead to total blindness?,False,"No — wet (neovascular) AMD can cause progressive, often severe central vision loss and may result in legal blindness, but it typically spares peripheral vision, so complete or total blindness is uncommon; early detection and treatment can slow or limit vision loss though central impairment may persist.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD cause straight lines to appear wavy?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration affects the macula and can distort central vision so that straight lines appear wavy—this is especially common with the neovascular (wet) form and its associated fluid and subretinal changes; diagnostic tests such as OCT can detect these changes, so see an eye specialist promptly if you notice distortion.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by a bacterial infection?,False,"No. Age-related macular degeneration is primarily an age-related degenerative and inflammatory condition rather than a bacterial infection. Infectious or inflammatory factors, including periodontal disease and elevated inflammatory markers, can worsen retinal inflammation and may increase risk, but there is no evidence that a bacterial infection is the direct cause of AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect depth perception?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages the macula and central vision, producing blurred and progressive central vision loss and reduced spatial and motion perception; these changes impair depth perception and make everyday tasks such as reading, driving and mobility more difficult, though some emerging therapies, implants and nutritional approaches may partially improve visual perception.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can children develop AMD?,False,"True age-related macular degeneration is a disorder of older adults and is driven mainly by aging, so children almost never develop classic AMD. Progressive central vision loss, drusen and neovascular changes described for AMD are characteristically seen in the elderly; when young people have macular degeneration or neovascular changes, other inherited or pediatric retinal disorders or different risk factors are more likely and should be evaluated.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD increase the need for visual aids?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly causes central and overall vision loss, reading and mobility difficulties, reduced driving ability and increased dependence, which in turn drives greater need for visual aids; magnifying and optical aids can improve reading speed, remaining vision and related emotional and cognitive outcomes, so people with AMD often require such support.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD linked to UV light exposure?,True,"Yes. Light exposure—especially high‑energy wavelengths such as blue and ultraviolet light—is implicated in the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration: excessive or chronic exposure can promote oxidative stress, inflammation, retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor damage and is linked to dry AMD and earlier disease onset, while effects vary with dose and pattern (with some reports that controlled intermittent UV exposure can improve certain high‑risk RPE cell phenotypes). Overall, intense or prolonged blue/UV light appears to be a modifiable risk factor for AMD.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Can AMD be reversed with exercise alone?,False,"No—exercise alone is unlikely to reverse established age-related macular degeneration. Regular physical activity may lower risk, slow progression, and improve retinal health and treatment responses, and vigorous activity is linked to reduced odds of intermediate and late disease, but advanced AMD can cause irreversible central vision loss and typically requires specific medical or eye-directed therapies rather than exercise as a sole treatment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect night vision more than daytime vision?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration mainly damages the macula and causes central, high‑acuity vision loss—blurred central vision, difficulty reading and driving, and reduced contrast and motion sensitivity—so it typically impairs daytime/detail tasks more than causing true night blindness; however, advanced or atrophic stages can also worsen low‑light vision as photoreceptors degenerate.",False,True,False,True,Positive
Can a dilated eye exam diagnose AMD?,True,"Yes. A comprehensive dilated eye exam is a primary way to detect and diagnose age-related macular degeneration by allowing direct visualization of the macula and retina to identify drusen, pigment changes, subretinal deposits, exudation or neovascular changes; imaging tests such as OCT or angiography are often used alongside the dilated exam to confirm the diagnosis and characterize disease subtype.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by reading in dim light?,False,"No — reading in dim light may cause temporary eye strain or difficulty reading but is not a known cause of age-related macular degeneration. AMD is a progressive, age-associated retinal disease influenced by factors such as aging, genetic and systemic factors, and retinal pathology, and it leads to central vision loss and reading difficulties; if you notice vision changes, see an eye care professional.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect the ability to recognize faces?,True,"Yes — age-related macular degeneration commonly impairs face recognition. Loss of central vision and symptoms such as blurring and distortion of faces, especially in forms like geographic atrophy, reduce the detail needed to identify facial features, and people with low vision from AMD often have difficulty recognizing faces.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD be cured with antibiotics?,False,No — wet age-related macular degeneration cannot be cured with antibiotics. The wet form is driven by abnormal blood-vessel growth and current treatments focus on controlling that process and slowing vision loss rather than curing the disease; antibiotics are used for eye infections or surgical prophylaxis but do not treat the underlying wet AMD.,False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD risk increase with age?,True,"Yes. The risk of age-related macular degeneration rises with increasing age—both the likelihood of developing AMD and its severity or progression increase in older adults—while genetic factors, systemic inflammation and cardiovascular risk can further modify that age-related risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD affect the central vision?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages the macula and commonly causes progressive impairment or loss of central vision — producing blurred or distorted sight and difficulty reading, driving, recognizing faces, and performing everyday tasks; both atrophic (dry) and neovascular (wet) forms can affect central vision and advanced disease may lead to severe or irreversible central vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is wet AMD caused by bacterial infections?,False,"No — wet AMD (the neovascular “wet” form of age-related macular degeneration) is caused by abnormal, leaking blood-vessel growth under the retina leading to rapid central vision loss, not by bacterial infections; it is linked to age and other noninfectious factors and is treated with intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapies, although infections can cause other eye vascular problems and systemic/inflammatory conditions (and periodontal disease has been associated with AMD) but bacteria are not the established cause of wet AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can dry AMD progress to geographic atrophy?,True,"Yes. The non‑neovascular (dry) form of age‑related macular degeneration can progress to geographic atrophy, an advanced late stage characterized by loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors that leads to central vision loss and permanent visual impairment; imaging and functional tests can detect and monitor geographic atrophy, and targeted therapies and investigational treatments are being used or studied to slow its progression.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD treatable with antibiotics?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is not treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics are used for eye infections such as endophthalmitis, while AMD is managed with other therapies aimed at slowing progression or treating neovascular changes; there is no antibiotic cure, though some antibiotics (e.g., tetracyclines) have been explored for related deposits and various experimental treatments are under investigation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD involve choroidal neovascularization?,True,"Yes — wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration is characterized by choroidal neovascularization, which often produces subretinal exudation and fibrosis and can cause severe vision loss; the abnormal vessels are detectable with imaging such as optical coherence tomography angiography and fluorescein angiography and are commonly treated with intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections and other therapies like photodynamic therapy.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented by avoiding all sunlight?,False,"Sunlight exposure is linked to an increased risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), with both past and current exposure implicated in early and late disease, but AMD is driven by multiple factors—age, genetics, inflammation and other health conditions—so completely avoiding sunlight would not reliably prevent AMD and is neither practical nor sufficient; prevention focuses on reducing modifiable risks, regular eye monitoring, and available treatments.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is smoking a risk factor for AMD?,True,"Yes. Smoking is a well‑recognized, modifiable risk factor for age‑related macular degeneration: smokers are more likely to develop AMD and to progress to late, neovascular, or advanced forms, smoking worsens macular disease, and cessation reduces the risk and progression.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause rapid vision loss?,False,"Dry (atrophic) age-related macular degeneration typically causes gradual, progressive central vision loss and can eventually lead to significant or irreversible impairment—particularly with geographic atrophy—but it usually does not produce sudden, rapid vision loss; rapid decline is more characteristic of the wet (neovascular) form.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD primarily a disease of the cornea?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is a disorder of the retina, specifically the macula, leading to central vision loss, blurred vision and potential irreversible blindness; it primarily affects retinal structures and central vision rather than the cornea, which is involved in different eye conditions.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does family history increase AMD risk?,True,Yes. A positive family history—including affected parents—raises the likelihood of developing age-related macular degeneration and is associated with greater risk of advanced or exudative (neovascular) forms.,True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be diagnosed with a urine test?,False,"Although some studies note urinary changes linked to AMD, the condition is diagnosed clinically with eye examinations and retinal imaging (for example color fundus photos and OCT); urine tests are not used to diagnose AMD in routine practice, though urine biomarkers may be explored in research.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is the Amsler grid used to monitor AMD symptoms?,True,Yes. The Amsler grid (Amsler test) is commonly used to monitor age-related macular degeneration symptoms—especially metamorphopsia and other visual distortions—and can help detect and track early or intermediate macular changes and progression of central vision problems.,True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause sudden vision changes?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD can produce sudden vision changes—patients may experience abrupt blurred or central vision loss when new fluid, bleeding, or a submacular hemorrhage develops—whereas the dry form more often causes a gradual decline.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is dry AMD more prevalent than wet AMD?,True,"The information lists both dry and wet forms of age-related macular degeneration and emphasizes many features, causes, complications, and emerging treatments for dry AMD while noting wet AMD’s neovascular nature and anti-VEGF therapies, but it does not state or quantify which form is more common, so no conclusion about relative prevalence can be drawn from these items alone.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be cured with dietary supplements alone?,False,"No—while antioxidant and xanthophyll-containing dietary supplements can help support macular pigment, improve some visual measures, and may slow or reduce progression of features like geographic atrophy or choroidal neovascularization, they do not cure age-related macular degeneration; AMD can cause irreversible central vision loss and requires medical and other interventions beyond supplements for management.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD contagious?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is not contagious. It is an age-related degenerative condition of the macula that leads to progressive central vision loss and blindness in older adults, influenced by age, genetics, inflammation and vascular factors, and diagnosed and managed medically, but it is not transmitted from person to person.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can optical coherence tomography detect AMD?,True,"Yes. Optical coherence tomography, including OCT angiography, reliably detects age-related macular degeneration and its signs—dry and neovascular forms—by visualizing retinal layers and microstructures, drusen and subretinal deposits, macular fluid, atrophy, and choroidal neovascular membranes, and it is widely used to diagnose disease activity, guide treatment decisions, and monitor progression.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is obesity a risk factor for AMD?,True,"Yes. Obesity — including BMI-defined obesity — is associated with a higher risk of developing age-related macular degeneration and with worse disease progression and late-stage AMD; it has been linked to increased incident AMD and visual decline, likely mediated in part by systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, altered lipids, and adverse effects on the retina.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be reversed with laser surgery?,False,"Laser procedures can treat certain forms of AMD—particularly the neovascular (wet) form and, in some contexts, geographic atrophy—by targeting the macula and retina to manage disease activity, but they do not typically reverse established vision loss or cure AMD; the condition often causes progressive, sometimes irreversible central vision impairment, and current therapies aim to slow progression and treat complications rather than restore lost retinal function.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can diabetes increase the risk of AMD?,True,"Yes — diabetes can raise the risk of age-related macular degeneration indirectly: diabetes is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and systemic inflammation, and those cardiovascular and inflammatory factors are linked to greater likelihood of developing AMD, so people with diabetes are more likely to develop AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD involve fluid buildup under the retina?,True,"Yes — wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration commonly involves fluid accumulation beneath (and often within) the retina; abnormal new blood vessels leak, producing subretinal and intraretinal fluid visible on OCT and typically treated with anti‑VEGF injections to reduce fluid and preserve vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD more common in women than men?,True,"Age-related macular degeneration affects both men and women, but it is reported more frequently in women overall; wet AMD in particular shows a higher proportion of affected women, and vision loss from eye diseases tends to disproportionately impact women.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD increase the risk of falls in older adults?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly causes central and general visual impairment in older adults, leading to poor spatial perception, reduced mobility and greater dependency; because visual impairment is linked to an increased risk of falls, AMD raises the likelihood of falls and related injuries in older people.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is photodynamic therapy a treatment for wet AMD?,True,"Yes. Photodynamic therapy—notably verteporfin-based and vascular-targeted approaches—has been used to treat wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration and associated choroidal neovascularization, and can be applied for related subtypes such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, though intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections are currently the primary standard of care.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented by wearing UV-protective sunglasses?,False,"Wearing UV-protective sunglasses can reduce harmful ultraviolet exposure to the eye and may lower the risk or delay the development of age-related macular degeneration, but AMD is multifactorial—strongly linked to age, genetics and other factors—so sunglasses are a useful protective measure but cannot guarantee prevention on their own.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD caused by a viral infection?,False,"No—based on the information provided, age-related macular degeneration is not shown to be caused by a viral infection; AMD is linked to aging, inflammatory and other risk factors and causes progressive central vision loss, while viral or bacterial infections can affect the retina and worsen retinal inflammation but are not described here as the direct cause of AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD primarily affect people over 60?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration predominantly affects older adults—especially those over 60—and is a leading cause of central and sometimes irreversible vision loss in the elderly worldwide, impacting roughly 200 million people and with risk increased by age (and other factors such as ethnicity).",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD reversible with current treatments?,False,"Current treatments do not reverse age-related macular degeneration; they can, however, treat the wet form and often slow or prevent further vision loss, sometimes stabilizing or modestly improving sight, while options for the dry/atrophic form are limited and largely cannot restore vision already lost. Advanced AMD can lead to irreversible central blindness, and outcomes depend on early detection, timely and consistent therapy, and the evolving but still limited results of newer approaches.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can wet AMD cause distorted vision?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration commonly causes distorted vision—straight lines may appear wavy and central vision can become blurred or lost—because leaking or abnormal blood vessels and fluid under the macula damage the central retina, leading to progressive central vision impairment that affects reading, driving, and daily tasks.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is high cholesterol a risk factor for AMD?,True,"Yes. The information indicates that higher cholesterol is associated with increased risk of age-related macular degeneration: elevated serum total cholesterol and higher HDL levels (and genetic variants affecting lipid transport), along with high‑fat/high‑cholesterol diets and other cardiovascular risk factors, have been linked to greater likelihood of developing AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD cause straight lines to appear wavy?,True,Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages the macula and commonly causes central vision loss and visual distortion—producing blurred or warped central vision that can make straight lines look wavy and lead to difficulty reading and other spatial-perception problems.,True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be cured with exercise alone?,False,"No — exercise alone cannot cure age-related macular degeneration. Regular physical activity may reduce risk, help slow progression, influence retinal health and treatment response, and provide general physical and mental benefits, but AMD can cause irreversible central vision loss and requires medical interventions; exercise can be a helpful complement to, not a replacement for, standard ophthalmic treatments.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can a dilated eye exam detect AMD?,True,"Yes. A dilated eye exam allows direct visualization of the retina and macula and can reveal hallmark signs of age-related macular degeneration—such as drusen, pigment changes, geographic atrophy, subretinal deposits, and evidence of neovascular (wet) disease like exudation or hemorrhage—after which imaging tests (eg, OCT/OCT-A and fundus photography) and slit-lamp assessment can confirm and subtype the condition to guide management, which is important since AMD can cause progressive central vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD be treated with antibiotics?,False,No — wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration is caused by abnormal new blood vessel growth and is treated with therapies that target that neovascular process; antibiotics are used to prevent or treat eye infections such as endophthalmitis but do not treat the underlying wet AMD.,False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is dry AMD associated with drusen deposits?,True,"Yes. Dry age-related macular degeneration is commonly associated with drusen deposits, including drusen-like material and subretinal drusenoid deposits that are characteristic of the dry form.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be diagnosed with an MRI?,False,"No — MRI is not typically used to diagnose age-related macular degeneration; AMD is identified with retinal tests like OCT/OCT‑A, color fundus photography and clinical examination, while MRI may image the eye or brain in research settings but is not a standard or sensitive diagnostic tool for macular disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause fluid leakage in the eye?,True,"Yes — wet (neovascular) age‑related macular degeneration involves abnormal new blood vessels beneath the retina that leak fluid and blood into and under the retina, causing swelling and vision loss; this process is driven by VEGF and is detected with imaging (e.g., OCT, fluorescein angiography) and commonly treated with intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections to reduce leakage and fluid.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD linked to cardiovascular disease?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration is linked to cardiovascular disease: cardiovascular conditions commonly coexist with AMD, cardiovascular health can influence AMD occurrence and progression, and having cardiovascular disease can worsen outcomes and quality of life for people with AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented with fish oil supplements alone?,False,"While fish oil and other supplements have been linked to beneficial effects and may help reduce disease severity or contribute to treatment, age-related macular degeneration is multifactorial—driven by age, genetics and other risk factors—and there is no single proven cure or sole preventative measure, so fish oil alone cannot be relied on to prevent AMD; it may, however, be considered as part of a broader prevention and treatment strategy alongside established therapies and risk-factor management.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect reading ability?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly impairs central vision and causes visual loss that leads to difficulty and reduced reading ability, with subtypes such as geographic or macular atrophy particularly worsening reading performance. Fortunately, low-vision interventions—magnifying aids, screen readers, specialized training, prosthetic central-vision approaches and certain optical or surgical options—can help improve reading for affected individuals.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive caffeine intake?,False,"No — excessive caffeine intake is not indicated as a cause of age-related macular degeneration; the provided information actually links higher caffeine consumption with a protective effect. AMD is primarily related to aging, genetic and inflammatory factors and can lead to progressive central vision loss and blindness, with abnormal blood-vessel growth underlying the wet form.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can fluorescein angiography diagnose wet AMD?,True,"Yes. Fluorescein angiography is commonly used to diagnose wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD by demonstrating choroidal neovascularization and active dye leakage, helping characterize classic versus occult lesions and neovascular subtypes; it is often used alongside OCT/OCT angiography to improve evaluation.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD only affect one eye at a time?,False,"No — AMD can affect one or both eyes: it often starts in one eye but can progress to involve the fellow eye, with both dry and neovascular forms targeting the macula and risking bilateral central vision loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD more prevalent in developed countries?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration is more common in developed countries and is a leading cause of central vision loss and blindness there, particularly as populations age. Its impact is rising with demographic shifts, influenced by factors such as age and ethnicity, and it places growing demands on eye-care services even as prevention and treatment efforts aim to reduce its burden.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD be reversed completely?,False,"Wet (neovascular) AMD is not usually completely reversible: current treatments can control abnormal blood vessel growth and fluid, often stabilizing and sometimes improving vision, but they rarely restore the retina to a fully healthy pre-disease state and permanent central vision loss can still occur. Ongoing research and experimental approaches, including cell therapies and novel agents, aim to improve outcomes, but there is no guaranteed cure that fully reverses established damage.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect the macula?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration directly involves the macula — both dry and neovascular (wet) forms manifest in the macula with features like drusen, subretinal deposits and altered macular thickness that lead to blurred or central vision loss, progressive and sometimes irreversible blindness, and reduced ability to read, drive or perform other tasks requiring detailed central vision; imaging and therapies (including anti‑VEGF agents) are used to diagnose and treat AMD, but it remains a leading cause of vision impairment in older adults.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by poor hygiene?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is primarily driven by aging, genetics, and other systemic or ocular factors rather than poor hygiene; while conditions tied to poor hygiene, such as periodontal disease and elevated inflammatory markers, have been linked to higher risk or worse outcomes, they do not establish poor hygiene as a direct cause of AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can low vision aids help manage AMD symptoms?,True,"Yes. Low vision aids and low-vision care cannot cure or reverse macular degeneration or its central vision loss, but they can substantially reduce its functional impact—improving reading, mobility, face recognition, independence and overall vision-related quality of life—and help lessen associated emotional distress. Evidence-based low-vision services combine devices, training and strategies to maximize remaining vision, though access and uptake may be limited by cost, stigma and limited awareness.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD affect driving ability?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly impairs central and overall vision, causing blurred vision, reduced spatial perception and motion sensitivity that degrade driving performance and safety. People with AMD often experience difficulty reading signs, problems with observation, lane keeping, gap selection and traffic-light situations, poorer driving-safety ratings, and increased dependence on others or cessation of driving.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive alcohol consumption?,False,"Yes. Alcohol consumption—especially heavier intake—has been linked to causing age-related macular degeneration, including both early and late forms, and can worsen visual outcomes and quality of life for people with AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD be inherited genetically?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration has a heritable component: inherited gene variants and rare familial retinal degenerations can increase a person’s risk. However, AMD is usually multifactorial—age, ethnicity, inflammation and other systemic and environmental factors also play major roles—so genetics influence susceptibility but do not fully determine whether someone will develop the disease.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause hemorrhages under the retina?,True,"Yes—neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration commonly causes bleeding beneath the retina, producing subretinal or submacular hemorrhages and other retinal hemorrhages that can worsen vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by staring at bright lights?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is primarily associated with aging and biological risk factors (inflammation, vascular and genetic influences) rather than being caused by staring at bright lights. Intense light can produce temporary visual symptoms, but it is not identified as a cause of AMD, and bright light is even used therapeutically in other contexts.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can regular eye exams detect AMD early?,True,"Yes. Regular eye exams that include visual testing and retinal imaging (such as fundus photos and OCT/OCT‑A/angiography) can detect early signs of age-related macular degeneration—drusen, pigment changes, subretinal deposits, or early neovascular changes—allowing diagnosis before substantial central vision loss. Early detection enables monitoring and timely treatment to slow progression and help preserve vision, although AMD can still cause progressive or irreversible central visual impairment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD cause floaters in the eye?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration mainly affects the macula and causes central blurring or vision loss rather than the movable “floaters” that arise from vitreous changes, inflammation, bleeding, or retinal tears; however, treatments for AMD (notably intravitreal injections) can produce transient or new vitreous floaters or haze, so a sudden increase in floaters warrants prompt eye evaluation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to lighter eye color?,True,"Some studies suggest eye color is associated with age-related macular degeneration, with lighter-colored eyes reported to carry a higher risk, but the association is modest and can be influenced by age, ethnicity, genetic factors and possible misclassification of eye color, so eye color alone is not a strong predictor of AMD.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Can AMD be cured with vitamin C alone?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration cannot be cured with vitamin C alone. Some evidence links higher vitamin C intake or adequate levels with lower risk or milder disease, and low vitamin C has been associated with worse forms, but AMD is a progressive condition that can cause irreversible central vision loss and has no single cure; treatments may slow or modify disease, and findings on supplementation are mixed and in some cases suggest possible harm.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD cause blind spots in central vision?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages the macula and commonly produces blind spots or loss in central vision; it is often progressive and can be irreversible in advanced forms, particularly the neovascular (wet) and atrophic (geographic atrophy) types, leading to central vision impairment and difficulties with reading, driving, and face recognition.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive sugar intake?,False,"Excessive sugar intake is not established as a direct cause of age-related macular degeneration. Poor blood sugar control and high sugar consumption can contribute to retinal damage and harmful metabolic byproducts and are important for preventing diabetic retinal disease, but AMD is primarily driven by age, genetic and inflammatory factors and by abnormal blood-vessel growth in the wet form. Good blood sugar control and managing inflammatory risks can help protect overall retinal health, yet AMD has distinct causes beyond simply excess sugar.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking cessation reduce AMD risk?,True,"Yes. Smoking is a clear, modifiable risk factor for age-related macular degeneration, and quitting smoking lowers the likelihood of developing AMD, reduces progression to advanced forms such as geographic atrophy, decreases lifetime AMD risk, and may improve treatment response and visual outcomes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD affect night vision exclusively?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages the macula and leads to progressive central and overall vision loss—causing blurred vision, difficulty reading and driving, reduced spatial perception and dependence—so it can produce serious visual impairment or blindness, but it does not affect night vision exclusively; night blindness is more characteristic of other retinal conditions rather than being the defining feature of AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD detectable with a retina scan?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration causes characteristic retinal changes that are visible on retinal imaging, and clinical tests—particularly optical coherence tomography (including OCT-A and spectral-domain B‑scan) and color fundus photography—routinely detect both dry and neovascular AMD by revealing drusen, subretinal deposits, exudation and neovascularization, so retinal scans are commonly used to diagnose and monitor AMD.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Can wet AMD be managed with dietary changes alone?,False,"Dietary changes and supplements can help reduce lifetime risk of AMD and support retinal health by improving key nutrients and lowering oxidative stress, but wet (neovascular) AMD involves active abnormal vessel growth and exudation that can cause rapid central vision loss and usually requires specialized medical treatments (often delivered into the eye); nutrition is a useful adjunct for prevention and overall eye health but is not sufficient as sole management for established wet AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD cause difficulty adapting to low light?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration often causes central vision loss and low vision, which make adapting to dim or low-light conditions difficult; people with AMD commonly have trouble reading and driving at night, experience blurred vision and motion sensitivity, and may face reduced mobility and greater reliance on others in low-light environments.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by a lack of sleep?,False,"No — the information provided does not support that AMD is caused by lack of sleep. Instead, links suggest AMD can impair sleep and that sleep disorders can affect eye health, but a direct causal role for sleep deprivation in triggering AMD is not shown; established contributors noted include age and inflammatory factors rather than sleep loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD be monitored with regular eye checkups?,True,"Yes. Routine eye checkups and screenings, using clinical exams and imaging tests (for example OCT/OCTA and fundus photos), can detect and monitor age-related macular degeneration by revealing early retinal changes and signs of progression. Regular testing enables earlier diagnosis, timely treatment or management to slow progression and reduce the risk of severe central vision loss or blindness, and helps track response to therapy.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause bleeding in the eye?,False,"No — the dry form of age‑related macular degeneration (geographic atrophy) typically causes progressive vision loss from retinal atrophy and is not associated with intraocular bleeding; bleeding is seen with the neovascular (wet) form of AMD, where abnormal blood vessels can leak or hemorrhage, and procedures like intravitreal injections or systemic bleeding risks can also contribute to ocular bleeding.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD more common in African Americans than Caucasians?,False,"Ethnicity influences AMD risk: genetic variants that increase susceptibility are more prominent in people of Caucasian/European descent, while African ancestry also plays a role but does not show the same pattern of high-risk variants, so AMD is generally more common in Caucasians than in African Americans.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD cause visual hallucinations in advanced stages?,True,"Yes. In advanced age-related macular degeneration, severe central vision loss and retinal deafferentation can trigger visual hallucinations—commonly experienced as Charles Bonnet syndrome—so people with greater vision loss from AMD are at higher risk of complex, often colorful hallucinations that stem from the eye condition rather than a psychiatric disorder.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD affect only the elderly over 80?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is strongly linked to advancing age and is common in older adults, but it is not limited to those over 80; risk and prevalence rise with age and with other genetic, systemic, and environmental factors, and it can occur earlier in the elderly and lead to central vision loss, progressive and sometimes irreversible blindness and functional impairment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to oxidative stress?,True,"Yes. Oxidative stress is widely implicated in AMD: oxidative damage is observed in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium, contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell senescence and death, and appears to drive and worsen AMD onset and progression, making antioxidant and dietary interventions a logical therapeutic target.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be treated with acupuncture?,False,"Acupuncture and related traditional Chinese medicine approaches have been used for age-related macular degeneration and have been reported to improve clinical outcomes, including best-corrected visual acuity; however, AMD is a progressive condition that can cause central and sometimes irreversible vision loss and currently has no definitive cure, so acupuncture may offer symptomatic or adjunctive benefit rather than a proven cure.",True,False,True,False,Negative
Does AMD increase the risk of depression?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration is linked to higher rates of depression: the central vision loss, functional limitations (difficulty reading, driving, mobility), dependence on others and associated emotional impacts increase risk, with advanced or wet forms particularly associated with depressive symptoms and secondary depression. Low-vision care and psychosocial interventions can help mitigate depressive symptoms.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive use of contact lenses?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is associated with aging and biological factors such as genetics, inflammation and abnormal blood-vessel growth rather than overuse of contact lenses; there’s no evidence that wearing contact lenses causes AMD, and contact lenses can even reduce UV exposure to the eye, while AMD itself leads to progressive central vision loss and, in advanced cases, blindness.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can fundus photography help diagnose AMD?,True,"Yes. Color and digital fundus photography can reveal hallmark signs of age‑related macular degeneration—drusen (including reticular/dot pseudodrusen), subretinal drusenoid deposits, RPE atrophy and geographic atrophy, neovascular changes with fibrosis and exudation—and is used to diagnose AMD and monitor its progression, often alongside cross‑sectional imaging such as OCT/OCT‑A for more detailed assessment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause scarring of the retina?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) age‑related macular degeneration, abnormal new blood vessels under the retina can leak and bleed persistently, and this ongoing leakage and hemorrhage commonly leads to scarring and fibrosis of the macula, resulting in macular scarring, central vision loss and potentially irreversible blindness.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by a lack of vitamin D?,False,"No — vitamin D deficiency has been associated with age‑related macular degeneration and lower levels may increase the risk of progression, while higher vitamin D or intake appears linked to reduced progression risk, but a lack of vitamin D is not established as the direct cause of AMD; the disease is multifactorial (age, genetics, and other factors) and more research is needed.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD affect the ability to judge distances?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages central vision and causes visual impairment that undermines spatial perception, motion sensitivity and mobility, leading to difficulties with distance and depth judgments and poorer performance and safety in tasks like driving, gap selection and lane keeping.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD always progress to wet AMD?,False,"No — dry AMD does not always progress to wet AMD. Many people remain in the dry form or develop advanced dry changes (geographic atrophy), while a subset can later develop neovascular (wet) changes that cause exudation and rapid vision loss; age, genetics, systemic factors, and regular monitoring influence that risk, and treatments exist to address neovascular conversion or slow damage.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD associated with about 11 million cases in the US?,True,"Yes — age-related macular degeneration affects roughly 11 million people in the United States and is a major cause of central and progressive vision loss, blindness, and reduced independence, with impacts on reading, driving, mobility and emotional well-being despite available treatments.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can wet AMD be prevented by avoiding all fats?,False,"No — the information provided does not support that avoiding all fats will prevent wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration. Wet AMD is linked primarily to age, genetic and inflammatory factors and abnormal neovascular/exudative changes in the retina, and the suggested preventive or therapeutic approaches focus on medical or interventional measures rather than complete fat elimination.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD cause blurred central vision?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) typically impairs central vision and commonly causes blurred central vision; both the dry form (including geographic atrophy) and the neovascular/wet form (choroidal neovascularization and related changes) produce central blurring and progressive central vision loss that can lead to significant visual impairment and, in severe cases, irreversible blindness.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is wet AMD caused by excessive tearing?,False,"No — wet AMD is not caused by excessive tearing (watery eyes). It is driven by abnormal growth of blood vessels under the macula (excessive angiogenesis/choroidal neovascularization) that leak fluid and blood, damaging central vision; retinal pigment epithelium tears can occur in neovascular disease but are a different retinal complication. Treatment typically targets the abnormal vessel growth, for example with intravitreal anti‑VEGF injections.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can dry AMD lead to thinning of the retina?,True,"Yes. Dry age-related macular degeneration, particularly in intermediate stages and in geographic atrophy, is associated with loss and thinning of retinal layers — including macular thinning and thinning of inner layers such as the ganglion cell complex and degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium — changes that contribute to central vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD treatable with hearing aids?,False,"No — hearing aids do not treat age-related macular degeneration or restore the central vision loss caused by the retinal disease. They can improve hearing and overall sensory function and may indirectly aid daily activities (and in some contexts be associated with modest visual gain), but vision problems from AMD are managed with vision-specific aids like magnifiers or optical devices and with disease-directed therapies rather than with hearing aids.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause rapid central vision loss?,True,"Yes—wet (neovascular/exudative) age-related macular degeneration can cause rapid loss of central vision and often leads to irreversible central visual impairment because abnormal, leaking vessels and exudation under the macula quickly damage the central retina, producing sudden declines in reading, driving, and face recognition.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented by avoiding all exercise?,False,"No — avoiding all exercise will not prevent age‑related macular degeneration; in fact, reduced physical activity is associated with worse ocular outcomes, while regular physical exercise has been linked to beneficial effects on retinal health, may influence AMD progression and treatment response, and supports overall well‑being (though very intense endurance exercise can increase oxidative stress, so balanced activity is preferable).",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is hypertension a risk factor for AMD?,True,"Yes. Hypertension is linked to a higher likelihood and faster progression of age-related macular degeneration: it promotes microvascular and choroidal changes, is associated with greater occurrence and advancement (including neovascular/wet AMD), and often accompanies other cardiovascular risks that further increase AMD risk, so managing blood pressure is relevant to lowering AMD-related risk.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause sudden vision changes?,False,"Dry (nonexudative) age-related macular degeneration typically causes gradual central vision loss, blurred vision and difficulty reading or driving; sudden or abrupt vision loss is more commonly caused by the neovascular (wet) form or complications like submacular hemorrhage, so sudden changes are uncommon with dry AMD unless it converts to wet disease or a related complication occurs.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can photodynamic therapy treat wet AMD?,True,"The provided information does not identify photodynamic therapy as a treatment for wet (neovascular) AMD; it highlights intravitreal anti-VEGF injections and other specific medical therapies as treatments for wet AMD, so based on these data photodynamic therapy is not shown as a recognized option.",False,True,False,True,Negative
Is AMD a disease of the iris?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration primarily affects the macula and retina, leading to central and progressive vision loss and blindness; it is not a disease of the iris. Although iris photographs or iris color have been studied in relation to AMD, the condition’s pathology and clinical impact are centered on the retinal macula rather than the iris.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD increase the need for brighter lighting?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly impairs central vision, contrast and light sensitivity, making everyday tasks like reading, recognizing details and driving harder in low light; people with AMD often benefit from brighter, well-distributed lighting to improve visibility and reduce difficulty under varying lighting conditions.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be diagnosed with a hearing test?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is an eye disease of the retina diagnosed by ophthalmic examinations and retinal imaging, while audiological tests detect hearing impairment; a hearing test cannot diagnose AMD. Some people with AMD may also have hearing problems and treating hearing can help overall sensory function, but hearing tests are not a substitute for an eye exam.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is fluorescein angiography used to detect wet AMD?,True,"Yes. Fluorescein angiography is used to detect wet (neovascular/exudative) age‑related macular degeneration by revealing choroidal neovascularization and characteristic dye leakage/abnormal vascular leakage, helping to characterize neovascular subtypes and guide management alongside OCT/OCTA and anti‑VEGF therapy.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause swelling beneath the retina?,True,"Yes. In neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration, abnormal new blood vessels beneath the retina leak fluid and blood, causing exudation and accumulation of subretinal fluid and retinal pigment epithelium swelling, which appears as swelling beneath the retina and can damage central vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is early AMD often asymptomatic?,True,"Yes — early age-related macular degeneration is frequently asymptomatic: many people have retinal changes detectable on exam or imaging without noticing symptoms, and measurable visual decline typically arises only in later stages.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be cured with herbal remedies?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is a progressive condition that can cause central and often irreversible vision loss, and there is currently no cure; medical treatments can slow progression or manage complications, but herbal remedies have not been shown to cure AMD and should not replace proven therapies—discuss any supplements or complementary approaches with an eye care professional.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does cardiovascular disease increase AMD risk?,True,"Yes. Poor cardiovascular health is linked to a higher likelihood of developing age-related macular degeneration; conditions such as hypertension and angina, along with shared risk factors like smoking and systemic inflammation, contribute to AMD occurrence and can worsen outcomes and quality of life for affected patients.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Is AMD caused by loud noises?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is not caused by loud noises. It is primarily linked to aging and biological factors such as genetics and inflammation, can be influenced by other health conditions, and affects the macula leading to central vision loss and blindness, with diagnosis and treatments focused on those underlying processes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can fundus autofluorescence imaging detect AMD?,True,"Yes. Fundus autofluorescence imaging can detect AMD: it reveals characteristic patterns such as reticular pseudodrusen and subretinal drusenoid deposits and highlights areas of decreased or hypoautofluorescence that correspond to geographic atrophy and its early stages, findings that are used clinically to diagnose and stage AMD and that relate to visual function loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD affect the sclera?,False,"Yes. Although AMD primarily damages the macula, retina and retinal pigment epithelium/choroid, it can involve adjacent tissues as part of the RPE–choroid–sclera complex and may produce findings that extend to the sclera, even though the main clinical impact is on central retinal vision.",True,False,True,False,Negative
Is oxidative stress a factor in AMD development?,True,"Yes. Oxidative stress is widely implicated as a key contributor to the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration: it is present in the retina and retinal pigment epithelium, promotes mitochondrial dysfunction, DNA damage, cell death and senescence, and aggravates AMD pathogenesis, while antioxidant interventions and certain dietary supplements have been shown to reduce oxidative stress and may help prevent or slow AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be reversed with meditation?,False,"There is no evidence that meditation can reverse age-related macular degeneration; the condition causes progressive, often irreversible damage to the macula and central vision, and although treatments can slow or manage disease and experimental approaches aim to protect or replace retinal cells, meditation may only help with emotional well‑being and coping rather than restore lost retinal structure or vision.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD impair the ability to see fine details?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) damages the macula and causes progressive central vision loss and visual impairment, which reduces the ability to see fine details and impairs tasks such as reading, driving, and face recognition; it often produces blurred central vision and can progress to severe vision loss or blindness.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by a lack of water intake?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is not known to be caused by a lack of water intake. AMD is primarily associated with aging, genetic, vascular and inflammatory factors; although some evidence links higher water intake with a lower risk, insufficient hydration has not been established as a direct cause of AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can late-stage AMD severely limit daily activities?,True,"Yes. Late-stage AMD damages central vision and can progress to severe visual impairment or legal blindness, producing poor central vision or irreversible vision loss that commonly prevents or greatly limits everyday tasks like reading, recognizing faces, driving, and self-care; low-vision rehabilitation and certain implants or treatments can sometimes help but many daily activities are nonetheless severely affected.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause gradual vision improvement?,False,"No — wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration typically causes progressive central vision loss, blurring and possible irreversible impairment due to abnormal leaking blood vessels and exudation; it does not produce gradual vision improvement, although some treatments and interventions can stabilize disease or restore some vision in certain patients.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD more severe in one eye than the other in some cases?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration often affects the two eyes differently, with one eye sometimes showing more advanced changes—such as neovascularization or geographic atrophy—while the other is less affected or at an earlier stage. This asymmetry can produce unequal central vision loss and functional impacts (reading, driving, emotional effects), so eye-by-eye evaluation and imaging are important for diagnosis and treatment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be treated with skin creams?,False,"No — AMD is a disease of the macula and retina that causes progressive central vision loss and is managed with ophthalmic treatments (including intravitreal drugs and emerging approaches such as TPC2 modulators, sildenafil in research, cell transplantation and growth-factor therapies), not with topical skin creams, which do not reach or treat retinal disease; current therapies may slow progression but there is no cure.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD increase the risk of social isolation?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration, especially in its late forms such as geographic atrophy, is linked to greater social isolation: central and progressive vision loss and related problems—difficulty reading, driving and mobility, dependency on others, impaired face perception, and emotional impacts—reduce social engagement and increase the risk of becoming isolated.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is dry AMD treated with anti-VEGF injections?,False,"No — anti‑VEGF injections are used to treat neovascular (wet/exudative) AMD and choroidal neovascularization, where they can reduce fluid and improve vision; they are not used to treat dry AMD (including geographic atrophy), which currently requires different or investigational approaches.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can smoking cessation reduce the progression of AMD?,True,"Yes. Stopping smoking is associated with a reduced progression of age-related macular degeneration, lowering the risk of late-stage forms such as geographic atrophy and neovascular disease and decreasing lifetime risk, so smoking cessation is an important modifiable step to help slow AMD progression.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD cause pain in the eyes?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration is primarily associated with central vision loss and visual impairment rather than being a direct cause of eye pain; however, certain forms (for example exudative/neovascular disease and geographic atrophy) and procedures used to treat AMD—such as frequent intravitreal injections and anti-VEGF therapies—have been reported to be associated with ocular pain, so pain can occur in specific subtypes or as a treatment-related effect.",True,False,True,False,Negative
Is AMD linked to reduced contrast sensitivity?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration is associated with reduced contrast sensitivity, especially in advanced or bilateral cases, and this loss contributes to difficulties with reading, driving and other visual tasks; certain treatments and nutritional or light-based interventions have been shown to partly improve contrast sensitivity.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented by avoiding all carbohydrates?,False,"No—there’s no support for the idea that avoiding all carbohydrates will prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Diet and carbohydrates can influence the gut microbiome and may play a role in age-related eye conditions, but AMD is driven by multiple factors such as age, genetics, inflammation and other systemic influences, and there is no single dietary cure or guaranteed prevention. Management emphasizes risk reduction, monitoring, and available treatments, so major dietary changes should be discussed with a healthcare professional.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause a gray spot in central vision?,True,"Yes — the neovascular (wet) form of age-related macular degeneration can produce a gray or dark spot in the center of vision because abnormal, leaky blood vessels damage the macula, causing central vision loss, blurring, or distortion; prompt evaluation by an eye care specialist is recommended.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive blinking?,False,"No — excessive blinking is not described as a cause of age-related macular degeneration. AMD is an age-related disease of the macula driven by aging, genetic and inflammatory factors and, in the wet form, by abnormal blood-vessel growth and leakage; it leads to progressive central vision loss and is linked to systemic and ocular risk factors rather than mechanical eyelid activity like blinking.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD affect the ability to see in low light?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration often causes central vision loss and low vision, which can reduce the ability to see in dim light or at night and make tasks like reading, mobility, and night driving more difficult.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause retinal hemorrhages?,False,"No — dry (atrophic) AMD typically does not cause retinal hemorrhages; bleeding is characteristically seen with the neovascular/exudative form of AMD and with other vascular retinal conditions (for example diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, hypertensive retinopathy) or after anticoagulation or intraocular procedures.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD detectable before symptoms appear?,True,Yes. Routine eye exams with retinal imaging (for example optical coherence tomography and fundus photography) and other diagnostic tests can reveal early structural changes—such as drusen and subretinal deposits—allowing AMD to be detected before vision symptoms or functional complaints appear.,True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be cured with cold compresses?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is a progressive disease of the macula that can cause central and sometimes irreversible vision loss, and it cannot be cured by cold compresses; while they may soothe surface irritation, diagnosis and management require medical evaluation and established or experimental therapies, and there is currently no definitive cure.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD cause difficulty seeing in bright light?,True,"Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages the central retina, causing blurred or lost central vision and problems with reading, driving, and recognizing detail; because it alters visual sensitivity and the retina can be affected by light exposure, many people with AMD experience difficulty in bright conditions and bright light can worsen or influence symptoms for some individuals.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is wet AMD caused by a vitamin deficiency?,False,"Wet AMD is not simply caused by a vitamin deficiency. Low vitamin D and other nutritional deficits have been linked to risk or progression of age-related macular degeneration and may influence early or late disease, but they are not established as the direct cause of the neovascular “wet” form, which involves abnormal choroidal blood vessel growth and is managed with anti-VEGF therapies; correcting deficiencies may help overall eye health but does not replace standard treatment.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase the need for magnifying devices?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration often causes central and progressive vision loss that makes reading and everyday tasks difficult and increases dependence, so affected people commonly require magnifying and other assistive devices, which can improve reading ability and speed, help with locating high-contrast objects, navigation and basic orientation, and support emotional and cognitive well‑being.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD affect the lens of the eye?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages the macula and retina, leading to central vision loss and visual impairment, and is distinct from lens conditions like cataract; although a few entries suggest an AMD–lens link, the overall evidence associates AMD with retinal pathology rather than direct effects on the lens, so AMD does not typically affect the lens.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to chronic inflammation?,True,"Yes. Chronic inflammation both contributes to the development and progression of age-related macular degeneration—promoting retinal pigment epithelium dysfunction, damage to supporting tissues, photoreceptor and retinal cell loss, and visual decline—and can be sustained or amplified by the disease itself. Systemic and local inflammatory drivers such as aging, oxidative stress, elevated CRP, and infections further feed this cycle, making inflammation a central factor in AMD pathogenesis and worsening.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented by avoiding all dairy?,False,"Based on the information provided, there is no evidence that avoiding all dairy can prevent age-related macular degeneration; the factors and interventions discussed point to age, genetic and inflammatory influences, other health conditions, and specific medical treatments or procedures as relevant to risk and management, but dairy avoidance is not mentioned as a preventive measure.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause a wavy appearance of objects?,True,"Yes — the wet (neovascular) form of age-related macular degeneration commonly causes objects to look wavy or distorted because abnormal new blood vessels and leaking fluid under the macula disrupt central retinal structure, producing blurred and central vision loss and difficulty reading; prompt eye testing and treatment can help limit further damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive hand washing?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is not caused by excessive hand washing. AMD is a degenerative retinal disease primarily associated with aging, genetic and inflammatory factors and, in the wet form, abnormal blood-vessel growth in the macula; it leads to central vision loss and can progress to severe visual impairment, but routine hand washing is not a cause.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD lead to legal blindness?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration can cause progressive central vision loss and significant visual impairment and, especially in advanced late-stage forms such as neovascular (wet) AMD or geographic atrophy, may lead to irreversible loss of vision that meets criteria for legal blindness, substantially affecting reading, driving, and daily activities.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause inflammation of the eyelids?,False,"Dry age-related macular degeneration primarily affects the macula and retina, causing central vision loss and other visual impairments, but it is not known to cause inflammation of the eyelids; eyelid inflammation is a separate eye condition and, although inflammatory processes can be associated with AMD inside the eye, eyelid redness or swelling should be evaluated for other causes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD associated with retinal pigment epithelial damage?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration is closely linked with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) damage: both atrophic and neovascular forms feature RPE loss, dysfunction or abnormal elevation/proliferation, which contributes to retinal degeneration and central vision loss, and many therapeutic approaches target or aim to replace/repair the RPE.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be treated with nasal sprays?,False,"There is no evidence that AMD can be treated with nasal sprays. Current and investigational approaches focus on directly targeting the retina or its supporting cells—such as intravitreal growth-factor treatments, cell transplantation, pharmacologic agents and other therapies—and although studies have noted associations with the nasal and oral microbiota, nasal sprays are not an established or recognized treatment for AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect the ability to see motion?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration can alter motion perception and create motion-related visual artifacts; by damaging central vision and reducing spatial perception and mobility, it can make it harder to detect and respond to moving objects, contributing to driving and observation errors.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive use of perfume?,False,"There is no indication here that excessive use of perfume causes age-related macular degeneration (AMD). AMD is linked mainly to aging and factors such as genetic variants, inflammatory markers (e.g., IL‑1, CRP), vascular and angiogenic processes underlying the wet form, and other health influences like periodontal disease, and some medication exposures have been reported to affect its incidence or progression; AMD can lead to progressive central vision loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase difficulty navigating crowded spaces?,True,"Yes.

Does wet AMD cause vision loss only in dim light?,False,"No — wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration does not cause vision loss only in dim light. It most often produces central, progressive and sometimes irreversible loss of vision and blurred central vision that impairs reading, driving, and daily tasks; low light can make symptoms more noticeable, but the deficit is not limited to dim conditions, and treatments such as anti‑VEGF injections can help slow or improve vision loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to reduced visual acuity?,True,"Yes — age-related macular degeneration commonly leads to reduced visual acuity, including central vision loss, blurred vision and progressive visual impairment that can become severe or blind in advanced cases; wet (neovascular) and bilateral forms often present with early acuity loss, while treatments such as intravitreal anti-VEGF therapies (e.g., ranibizumab, aflibercept) and related interventions can improve or stabilize vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented by avoiding all protein?,False,"No—there is no evidence that avoiding all protein prevents age-related macular degeneration. AMD is driven by age, genetics, inflammation and retinal degeneration processes, and while certain proteins and inflammatory markers are implicated in the disease, that reflects underlying biology rather than a reason to eliminate dietary protein; doing so could be unnecessary or harmful. For prevention and management, follow established risk‑factor guidance and medical advice from an eye specialist.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause small blind spots over time?,True,"Yes. Dry age-related macular degeneration gradually damages the macula and can produce small blind spots (central scotomas) that enlarge over time, leading to progressive central vision loss and difficulties with reading, driving, and other tasks; this decline can be irreversible and may ultimately cause significant visual impairment.",True,True,True,True,Neutral

Does wet AMD cause a ripple effect in vision?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration commonly causes central visual distortion—things can appear blurred, wavy or ""rippled""—and can lead to progressive central vision loss that impairs reading, driving and daily activities; prompt diagnosis and treatments such as anti‑VEGF therapy can reduce fluid, limit further damage and sometimes improve vision.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive foot massages?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is not caused by excessive foot massages. AMD is an age-related degeneration of the macula that can lead to central and progressive vision loss and blindness; its risk and mechanisms are linked to aging, genetic factors, inflammation and systemic markers like CRP, retinal vascular and neurodegenerative changes, and in the wet form abnormal blood-vessel growth, with diagnosis by retinal imaging and treatments aimed at those processes.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD affect the ability to play card games?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages central vision, causing blurred vision, loss of fine detail, difficulty reading and reduced spatial perception, all of which make identifying, handling, and reading playing cards harder and can limit participation; however, low-vision aids, training, and other supportive measures can help compensate and improve the ability to play.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause rapid photoreceptor regeneration?,False,"No — dry age-related macular degeneration leads to gradual photoreceptor loss and geographic atrophy with progressive, often irreversible central vision impairment; it does not produce rapid photoreceptor regeneration. Experimental approaches (for example stem cell or gene-based strategies) aim to promote retinal or photoreceptor regeneration, but regeneration is not a natural consequence of the disease.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to difficulty seeing traffic signs?,True,"Yes.

Can AMD be treated with throat lozenges?,False,"No—throat lozenges cannot treat age-related macular degeneration. AMD is a progressive retinal disease affecting the macula and central vision; management involves ocular-targeted therapies (and experimental approaches like intraocular drugs or cell-based treatments) rather than symptomatic throat remedies, and lozenges would not reach or influence retinal pathology.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD cause trouble seeing in dimly lit rooms?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages the macula and commonly causes central, progressive vision loss, blurred vision and difficulty with reading, mobility and driving, which often makes seeing and doing tasks in dimly lit rooms harder and can lead to frustration and dependence on others.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is wet AMD caused by excessive use of toothpaste?,False,"No — wet age-related macular degeneration is caused by abnormal growth and leakage of blood vessels under the retina driven by factors like VEGF, which leads to fluid/exudation and central vision loss and is treated with intravitreal anti‑VEGF therapy; there is no evidence in the provided information linking excessive toothpaste use to causing wet AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD affect the ability to enjoy painting?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration often causes central vision loss, blurred or reduced visual acuity, poor spatial perception and difficulty with fine visual tasks, which can make detailed activities like painting harder and less enjoyable and can bring frustration and increased dependence; low-vision aids, rehabilitation and some medical or surgical interventions can, however, help improve function and support continued engagement in visual hobbies.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD cause vision loss due to corneal scarring?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration is a well-established cause of progressive, often central vision loss, but that loss stems from damage and scarring of the macula and subretinal tissues (for example from neovascularization and hemorrhage), not from corneal scarring; corneal scarring reflects other ocular problems and is not the mechanism by which AMD impairs vision.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to difficulty identifying coins?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration causes central vision loss, blurred vision and reduced ability to see fine detail and contrast, leading to problems with reading and other close-up tasks; in advanced forms such as geographic atrophy this visual impairment and poorer spatial perception make identifying coins and similar small objects likely to be difficult.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented by avoiding all liquids?,False,"No — avoiding all liquids will not prevent age-related macular degeneration. AMD is driven by age, genetics, inflammation and other systemic factors and leads to progressive central vision loss; it is diagnosed and managed with medical and surgical approaches rather than by restricting fluids, and there is no evidence that eliminating liquids prevents the disease (and doing so could harm overall health).",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause a central haze in vision?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration commonly produces central blurring or a hazy, distorted spot and sometimes a central dark or missing area; abnormal leaking blood vessels under the macula cause exudation and damage that leads to progressive central vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral

Does AMD affect the pupil directly?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages the macula and central retina, causing central vision loss and visual impairment rather than directly altering pupil size or function; pupil changes are typically encountered in diagnostic testing or when pupils are dilated to improve measurements, so any pupil effects are indirect or procedural rather than a direct consequence of AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is retinal hypoxia a factor in AMD progression?,True,"Yes. Retinal hypoxia is implicated in AMD progression: it is observed in the disease and can drive VEGF-mediated neovascularization, abnormal vessel growth and leakiness, promote RPE degeneration and retinal cell loss, and thereby worsen disease progression; conversely, vessel closure or some anti-VEGF effects can exacerbate hypoxia, while treatments that reduce hypoxia may help limit progression.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be reversed with chiropractic care?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is a progressive condition that commonly causes irreversible central vision loss and there are no cures that simply reverse the disease.

Is AMD caused by a lack of dietary protein?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is not shown to be caused by a lack of dietary protein. AMD is a multifactorial disease driven mainly by age, genetic and inflammatory factors, and can lead to progressive central vision loss and blindness; nutritional approaches such as specific dietary recommendations and supplements (notably those affecting omega‑3 fatty acids and related nutrients) may help prevent or slow progression, but protein deficiency is not identified as a causal factor.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can advanced AMD limit independence?,True,"Yes. Advanced age-related macular degeneration causes progressive central vision loss and visual impairment that can make reading, driving, spatial perception, mobility, and everyday tasks difficult, increasing dependence on others and reducing independence and safety; emotional impacts and frustration often accompany these limitations, though assistive technologies such as implantable miniature telescopes and other aids can help improve independence for some people.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause gradual central vision recovery?,False,"No — wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration characteristically causes central vision loss, often sudden or progressive due to abnormal new vessels and leakage, and can lead to irreversible impairment; any gradual recovery of central vision would generally result from timely medical treatment rather than the disease itself.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to difficulty seeing in crowded places?,True,"Yes.

Does AMD cause inflammation of the cornea?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration is linked to inflammatory processes in the retina and eye overall, and inflammation plays a role in AMD, but the evidence points to retinal/ocular inflammation rather than inflammation of the cornea; although ocular inflammation can involve the cornea, there is no direct indication here that AMD specifically causes corneal inflammation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD associated with reduced ability to see details in art?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages central vision and impairs processing of fine visual details, leading to blurred or lost central vision and difficulty recognizing small or intricate features—so people with AMD often struggle to see fine details in artworks, read, or perform tasks requiring detailed vision; low-vision aids and specialized training can help partially compensate.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause a dark central patch?,True,"Yes. The neovascular (wet) form of age-related macular degeneration can produce a dark central patch or loss in the center of vision because abnormal new vessels and associated fluid/exudation at the macula damage central retinal tissue, causing central vision loss and blurring; prompt eye evaluation and treatment can help limit further damage.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive use of air conditioning?,False,"There is no direct evidence that excessive use of air conditioning causes age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Can AMD affect the ability to enjoy birdwatching?,True,"Yes. Age‑related macular degeneration commonly damages central vision and visual acuity, causing blurred vision, loss of detail, reduced color and motion sensitivity and observation errors, all of which can make spotting and identifying birds harder and reduce independence and enjoyment; however, low‑vision interventions, magnifying aids and targeted training can partly compensate and help people continue birdwatching.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does dry AMD cause optic nerve swelling?,False,"No — dry age-related macular degeneration primarily affects the macula and outer retina, causing drusen, geographic atrophy and progressive central vision loss, and is not known to produce optic nerve swelling; optic disc edema is more characteristic of optic neuritis, glaucoma or other optic neuropathies and should prompt evaluation for those conditions rather than attribution to dry AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD detectable with regular vision screenings?,True,"Yes. Regular vision screenings and appropriate eye tests can detect signs of age-related macular degeneration early: the condition often causes blurred or central vision loss and produces visible changes on retinal examination and imaging, so routine screening and diagnostic testing can identify AMD and enable earlier intervention to help limit progression.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Can AMD be cured with heat therapy?,False,"No—AMD is not cured by heat therapy. Some heat-related approaches, such as subthreshold laser, can induce protective heat-shock responses and are used as part of treatment to manage certain forms of AMD and improve visual or anatomical outcomes, but current therapies only treat or slow progression of neovascular and dry forms rather than curing the progressive vision loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD cause difficulty seeing in bright sunlight?,True,"Age-related macular degeneration commonly causes central vision loss, blurred vision and other visual impairments that make reading, driving and everyday tasks harder and can increase sensitivity to visual disturbances; these deficits often make bright sunlight or glare more problematic. Sunlight exposure is also implicated as a risk factor for AMD, but the available information links AMD to general visual difficulty rather than explicitly naming a distinct symptom of light intolerance.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is wet AMD caused by a lack of dietary fiber?,False,"No. Wet age-related macular degeneration is driven by abnormal blood-vessel growth under the macula and is linked to age, inflammation, genetics and other eye-specific factors, leading to central vision loss and treated with anti‑VEGF therapies; diet and supplements can influence risk or progression, but there is no indication that a lack of dietary fiber specifically causes wet AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD increase the need for reading glasses?,True,"Yes.

Does dry AMD cause optic nerve inflammation?,False,"Based on the information provided, dry age-related macular degeneration primarily affects the macula and retina and leads to central vision loss, but it is not shown to directly cause optic nerve inflammation (optic neuritis); optic nerve inflammation in the data is linked to other conditions such as glaucoma and oxidative damage rather than AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD associated with trouble reading digital clocks?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly causes central vision loss, blurred vision, and difficulty reading, so people with AMD often struggle with small near tasks such as reading digital clocks. Subtypes like geographic atrophy can worsen reading difficulty, but low-vision aids, training, and assistive devices (magnifiers, screen readers, tablets) can improve the ability to read small digital displays.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be treated with antacids?,False,"No — antacids are not a treatment for age-related macular degeneration. AMD is a retinal disease that can cause central and progressive vision loss and is managed with eye-specific therapies and investigational approaches (for example, intraocular drugs, growth‑factor or cell‑based treatments), so people with AMD need evaluation and treatment by an eye specialist rather than antacid therapy.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD affect the ability to read fine print on bottles?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages the central part of vision responsible for fine detail, causing blurred or lost central vision and making it hard to read small print on bottles; however, magnifying aids, low-vision training and other interventions can often help improve reading ability.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive exposure to fog?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is associated with aging, excessive light/UV exposure, genetic and inflammatory factors and other ocular conditions, and can lead to central vision loss and blindness; exposure to fog is not indicated as a cause.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD impair the ability to use a keypad?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration commonly causes central vision loss, blurred vision and difficulty reading and seeing fine detail, which can make it hard to accurately view and press keys on a keypad; people with AMD may experience reduced spatial perception and greater reliance on others, though low-vision aids, magnifiers, screen readers and training can help compensate.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause inflammation of the optic nerve?,False,"Wet (neovascular) AMD involves inflammatory processes in the retina and eye, but it is not typically a direct cause of optic nerve inflammation; optic nerve inflammation (e.g., optic neuritis or edema) usually arises from other ocular or systemic inflammatory disorders, though severe intraocular inflammation could rarely secondarily affect the optic nerve.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to difficulty seeing in misty conditions?,True,"Yes. AMD commonly causes central and general vision loss, blurred vision and sensitivity to motion, and is associated with difficulty reading, driving and with spatial perception and mobility problems—deficits that make seeing in misty or low-visibility conditions more difficult.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Can AMD be cured with garlic extract?,False,"There is no evidence that garlic extract cures age-related macular degeneration. AMD is a progressive condition that can cause central and sometimes irreversible vision loss and currently has no cure; some experimental extracts and treatments can influence disease processes or slow progression, but garlic extract is not identified as a proven therapy. People with AMD should rely on established medical care and discuss options with an eye specialist.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD cause trouble identifying visual textures?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages central vision and causes blurred vision, loss of fine-detail and contrast sensitivity, motion sensitivity and other visual dysfunctions, so people with AMD commonly have difficulty perceiving and identifying visual textures and other fine spatial details, affecting reading, mobility and driving.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is dry AMD caused by excessive exposure to pollen?,False,No — dry age‑related macular degeneration is not caused by pollen. It is an age‑related condition linked to aging and factors such as excessive light/UV exposure and inflammatory or systemic influences; abnormal blood‑vessel growth relates to the wet form rather than the dry form.,False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD affect the ability to enjoy detailed scenery?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages the macula and leads to progressive loss of central, detailed vision and blurred or impaired sight, which makes reading, recognizing faces, driving and appreciating fine details in scenery difficult and can markedly reduce enjoyment of detailed landscapes.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD cause vision loss due to optic disc damage?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration causes vision loss by damaging the macula—affecting photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium—leading to central and sometimes irreversible visual impairment, particularly from geographic atrophy or neovascular complications. It does not typically produce vision loss by damaging the optic disc; optic disc/optic nerve injury and peripheral field loss are characteristic of glaucoma or optic neuropathies rather than AMD, though occasional optic-disc findings may appear on imaging.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is AMD linked to difficulty reading price tags?,True,"Yes — age-related macular degeneration (AMD) commonly impairs central vision and causes blurred or progressive loss of sight, which frequently makes reading small print such as price tags difficult; advanced forms like geographic atrophy particularly worsen reading ability and can reduce independence and quality of life, although low-vision aids, training, and some interventions can help improve reading performance.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause a central visual ripple?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular) age-related macular degeneration commonly produces central visual disturbances — people often notice waviness, rippling or distortion in their central vision, along with blurring and progressive central vision loss that can become severe.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by excessive use of lotion?,False,"No — age-related macular degeneration is not caused by excessive use of lotion. AMD is linked to aging, genetic and inflammatory factors, retinal and vascular changes, and certain systemic conditions or medications can influence its risk or progression, but topical lotions are not known to cause AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can AMD impair the ability to sew fine stitches?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages central vision and the ability to see fine detail, causing blurred vision and progressive loss of central and near vision that makes close, precise tasks like sewing fine stitches difficult or impossible; low-vision aids, magnifiers, and special training can sometimes help compensate but the condition often produces lasting limitations.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD cause difficulty seeing straight lines as straight?,True,"Age-related macular degeneration primarily affects central vision and is linked with blurred or distorted vision, difficulty reading and driving, and other central visual impairments; although the data here do not explicitly state that AMD makes straight lines appear wavy, the central vision loss and visual distortion it causes make that symptom plausible.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is wet AMD caused by excessive exposure to blue light?,False,"The information indicates that excessive blue‑light exposure can damage retinal cells and is implicated in the development or worsening of dry AMD, but it does not establish a direct causal link to the wet (neovascular) form. Wet AMD is driven by abnormal blood‑vessel growth and leakage (angiogenesis) and is managed with anti‑VEGF treatments; while blue light may contribute to retinal injury and AMD risk, it is not shown here to directly cause wet AMD.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can dry AMD lead to atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium?,True,"Yes. The non-neovascular (dry) form of age-related macular degeneration can progress to geographic atrophy, a late-stage change marked by focal atrophy and loss of retinal pigment epithelial cells (with overlying photoreceptor loss) in the central retina, resulting in permanent central vision decline and reduced retinal function.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD treatable with herbal eye washes?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a progressive retinal condition with no proven cure; effective, evidence-based treatments—especially for the wet form—include intravitreal anti-VEGF injections and other medical or surgical approaches, while dietary supplements such as lutein and zeaxanthin may provide supportive benefit for some. There is no credible evidence that herbal eye washes can treat or reverse AMD, and using unproven topical remedies can delay proven care or cause harm, so consult an ophthalmologist for appropriate management.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause leakage of blood into the retina?,True,"Yes. In wet (neovascular or exudative) AMD abnormal new blood vessels grow and commonly leak fluid and blood into and under the retina, causing hemorrhage, exudation and rapid central vision loss; this vascular leakage is a hallmark of neovascular AMD and is the target of anti‑VEGF treatments.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be prevented by avoiding all artificial light?,False,"Completely avoiding artificial light is unlikely to prevent age-related macular degeneration. AMD is driven mainly by age, genetics and systemic factors, and although artificial light can affect the retina and nighttime light can disrupt circadian rhythms, there’s no clear evidence that eliminating artificial light prevents AMD; prevention and management rely on addressing known risk factors, regular monitoring, and available treatments rather than total light avoidance.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is a history of stroke a risk factor for AMD?,True,"The information does not show a clear, direct link that a prior stroke independently causes age-related macular degeneration; however stroke is tied to vascular and cardiovascular risk factors that are associated with AMD, and some wet/exudative AMD findings are observed alongside stroke, suggesting an association likely driven by shared vascular risk rather than proven causation.",True,False,True,False,Positive
Does dry AMD cause immediate distortion of central vision?,False,"Dry (atrophic) AMD usually produces gradual central vision loss, blurring and related difficulties and can cause distortion, but it typically does not produce an immediate, sudden distortion of central vision; sudden new distortion is more suggestive of wet (neovascular) AMD and warrants prompt eye evaluation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can dark adaptometry testing detect AMD-related vision changes?,True,"Yes. Dark adaptometry assesses visual sensitivity loss, and because age-related macular degeneration produces characteristic vision changes, this testing can reveal AMD-related impairments and help inform diagnosis and clinical management.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD a condition affecting the tear ducts?,False,No. Age-related macular degeneration is a disease of the retina and macula that causes central vision loss and can lead to blindness; it is not a disorder of the tear ducts or the lacrimal system and does not primarily affect tear production.,False,False,False,False,Neutral
Does AMD impair the ability to see subtle gradients?,True,"Yes. Age-related macular degeneration damages the macula and leads to progressive central and overall vision loss, blurred vision and subtle declines in best-corrected visual acuity, which manifest as difficulty reading, impaired spatial perception and motion sensitivity—changes that reduce the ability to detect fine luminance and contrast differences and thus make seeing subtle gradients more difficult.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD be diagnosed with an electrocardiogram?,False,"No — an electrocardiogram, which assesses heart electrical activity, cannot diagnose age-related macular degeneration. AMD is identified by ophthalmic tests and retinal imaging such as OCT and color fundus photography along with clinical eye examination of the macula and retina.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is microperimetry useful for assessing AMD progression?,True,"Yes. Microperimetry is a useful tool for monitoring age-related macular degeneration because it maps retinal sensitivity and fixation across foveal and parafoveal areas, detects focal functional losses and changes in macular function over time, and thus complements structural imaging and acuity measures to track disease progression and the functional natural history of AMD.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD cause abnormal growth of choroidal blood vessels?,True,"Yes. Wet (neovascular or exudative) age-related macular degeneration involves abnormal growth of choroidal blood vessels—choroidal neovascularization—that leaks fluid and blood under the retina, causing exudation and central vision loss and is the target of anti‑angiogenic treatments.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does wet AMD involve abnormal blood vessel growth?,True,"Yes. Wet age-related macular degeneration—also called neovascular or exudative AMD—is driven by abnormal growth of blood vessels beneath the retina (choroidal neovascularization) that leak fluid and blood, causing exudation and vision loss, and is treated with anti‑VEGF intravitreal injections to inhibit that vessel growth.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD curable with current treatments?,False,"Current treatments do not cure age-related macular degeneration; they can treat and slow progression—especially the neovascular (wet) form—by reducing exudation and helping prevent further vision loss, and they manage symptoms, but the disease can still cause progressive and sometimes irreversible central vision loss, with options for the atrophic (dry) form largely limited to slowing progression rather than restoring lost vision.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Are drusen deposits a sign of early dry AMD?,True,Yes. Drusen—yellowish deposits beneath the retinal pigment epithelium—are a characteristic sign of early dry age-related macular degeneration; finding drusen (including large soft drusen or drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments) indicates early-stage disease and identifies eyes at higher risk of progression to advanced atrophy and vision loss.,True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD primarily affect peripheral vision?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration primarily damages the macula and causes central vision loss and related problems like difficulty reading and driving; peripheral vision is generally preserved, although advanced or atrophic stages can leave peripheral vision lower in resolution rather than being the main area affected.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can anti-VEGF injections slow wet AMD progression?,True,"Yes — anti‑VEGF injections into the eye are the standard treatment for wet (neovascular/exudative) AMD and can slow disease progression by reducing abnormal vessel activity and fluid, preserving and often improving visual acuity and lowering the risk of severe vision loss; these benefits are greatest with timely, regular treatment, but repeated injections carry treatment burden, cost, and potential ocular risks (including sustained intraocular pressure rise and other injection‑related complications) that should be considered.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Does AMD only occur in people under 50?,False,"No. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is primarily a disease of older adults and is far more common in the elderly, causing progressive central vision loss and even blindness and affecting roughly 200 million people worldwide; it is not limited to people under 50, although early or uncommon hereditary forms can occur.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Is geographic atrophy an advanced form of dry AMD?,True,"Yes. Geographic atrophy is the advanced, atrophic (non‑exudative) form of dry age‑related macular degeneration, representing late or end‑stage disease with loss of retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors that leads to central vision loss.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Can AMD cause complete blindness in all cases?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration can cause progressive central vision loss and in advanced forms—particularly neovascular (wet) AMD or geographic atrophy—may lead to severe visual impairment or legal blindness, but it does not cause complete loss of all vision in every case because it mainly damages the macula and peripheral vision is often preserved; complete blindness generally requires widespread loss of photoreceptors or retinal/optic nerve damage, and early diagnosis and treatment can prevent many cases from reaching severe vision loss.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
Can the Amsler grid help detect vision changes in AMD?,True,"Yes. The Amsler grid and similar central-vision test patterns can reveal early and progressive central vision changes in age-related macular degeneration by detecting visual distortions, blurring, or loss in the central field, making it a simple, useful tool for monitoring AMD alongside clinical evaluation.",True,True,True,True,Neutral
Is AMD caused by bacterial infection?,False,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a degenerative, age-related condition driven by multiple factors rather than a direct bacterial infection. Bacterial infections are not established as the primary cause, but inflammatory conditions—such as periodontal disease and elevated inflammatory markers like CRP and interleukin-1—are linked to higher risk or worsening of AMD, and infections can aggravate retinal inflammation.",False,False,False,False,Neutral
