Which retinal layer is most affected by AMD? a) Ganglion cell layer b) Macula c) Outer plexiform layer d) Choroid,b) Macula,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) primarily affects the macula, which is a part of the retina. More specifically, AMD impacts the retinal ganglion layer, outer plexiform layer, and outer nuclear layer. The choroid, another retinal layer, can also be affected by AMD. However, the ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer are less directly associated with AMD. Instead, they are often impacted in conditions related to or co-occurring with AMD, such as intermediate age-related macular degeneration and inner retinal degeneration. The retinal ganglion layer is often affected in various stages and types of AMD, including geographic atrophy and neovascular AMD. The outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers are also affected by specific subtypes of AMD, like i AMD and rPD with outer retinal atrophy. Drusen, a common symptom of AMD, can lead to local retinal degeneration and affect the ganglion cell layer.

Drusen are yellowish, proteinaceous deposits that form between the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying choroid. These deposits can be detected using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, which improves the visibility of retinal features. Drusen deposits are often associated with the overexpression of secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42, which can cause drusen-like deposits. Additionally, changes in choroidal perfusion can lead to deposits that generate drusen. While dry AMD does not involve fluid leakage, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can still play a role in the disease, as it causes blood vessel growth and aggravates blood vessel leakage.

Which symptom is most associated with wet AMD? a) Gradual peripheral loss b) Sudden central blur c) Eye redness d) Floaters,b) Sudden central blur,"Wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) is a medical condition commonly associated with central blurring of vision. This symptom is attributed to choroidal neovascularization, a key characteristic of wet AMD. The condition can lead to severe vision loss and blindness if not managed promptly. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs, such as aflibercept, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab, are currently employed to treat wet AMD, targeting VEGF to reduce abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Faricimab is another treatment option that inhibits the ang-tie pathway, which also contributes to the pathogenesis of wet AMD. These therapies can help improve best-corrected visual acuity, reduce retinal center point thickness, and potentially decrease the need for retreatments or missing clinic visits.

What visual ability does AMD often impair? a) Color perception b) Hearing acuity c) Taste sensitivity d) Peripheral motion,a) Color perception,"Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) often impairs visual abilities related to peripheral motion and reading. This is due to degenerative changes in the macula, a central area of the retina, which can lead to general vision loss, irreversible blindness, and visual impairment. AMD may also affect color perception, although this is not as common. The condition causes progressive loss of vision and becomes more prevalent with age. Factors like ethnicity and certain health issues, such as periodontal disease or hyperhomocysteinemia, can increase the risk of AMD.

This onset is associated with the development of choroidal neovascularization, which is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels from the choroid layer into the retina. This abnormal growth can cause fluid and blood to leak into the retina, leading to the sudden vision loss observed in wet AMD. The condition is often treated with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs, which work by inhibiting the growth of new blood vessels and reducing fluid leakage in the retina.

This form of AMD is characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina, which often results in subretinal fluid accumulation. The presence of this subretinal fluid can negatively impact visual acuity and may require anti-VEGF therapy for management. Delayed follow-up visits can affect subretinal fluid levels, while certain medications, such as aflibercept, can improve it. Subretinal fluid accumulation may also be associated with other retinal disorders, such as macular edema, subthreshold exudative choroidal neovascularization, and atrophic AMD, among others.

This disorder typically impacts the central vision, making it challenging for individuals to read, drive, or perform other tasks that require clear and precise vision. AMD can lead to progressive loss of vision and, in some cases, may cause irreversible blindness. The condition is more prevalent among the elderly and specific ethnicities, and it's associated with various retinal changes, including subretinal drusenoid deposits, subtypes of neovascularization, and geographic atrophy. AMD can also negatively influence driving performance, leading to motion sensitivity, observation errors, lane-keeping errors, and issues at traffic light-controlled intersections. Several therapies, such as anti-VEGF injections, intravitreal treatments with antibody-based biopharmaceutical compounds, and stem cell transplantation, have been shown to improve visual acuity in AMD patients.

This condition is directly related to wet AMD, which affects the macula, a part of the eye responsible for central vision. The presence of macular edema can lead to vision loss and is often caused by leakage across the retinal pigment epithelium due to neovascularization, a process where new blood vessels grow into the retina. This growth of abnormal blood vessels is driven by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is targeted by various treatments for wet AMD, including intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, photodynamic therapy, and aflibercept.
