Is night vision the primary loss in AMD? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Only wet AMD,B,"
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that primarily affects the central vision, leading to progressive vision loss and potential blindness. The most significant loss of night vision in AMD is not its primary characteristic but rather a secondary effect of the disease's progression. While AMD can cause vision loss and affect various aspects of vision, including central vision, peripheral vision, and overall visual acuity, it does not inherently target night vision as its primary concern. The presence of wet AMD, characterized by choroidal neovascularization, is a more severe form of the disease that can lead to significant vision loss, including night vision impairment. However, the primary loss of night vision in AMD is more closely associated with conditions like late-onset night blindness, which is linked to inadequate regeneration of the visual pigment rhodopsin and other factors. Treatments such as intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections, anti-VEGF medications, and other therapies can help manage wet AMD and improve vision, but they do not directly address the primary cause of night vision loss in AMD.","
