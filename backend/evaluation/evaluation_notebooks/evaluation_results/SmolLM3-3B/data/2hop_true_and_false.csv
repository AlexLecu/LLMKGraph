Can wet AMD impair driving by distorting central visual acuity?,True,"
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can indeed impair driving by distorting central visual acuity. This is because AMD, a leading cause of vision loss in older adults, often results in the gradual deterioration of the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision. As AMD progresses, it can lead to the formation of drusen, a build-up of waste material beneath the retina, and the growth of abnormal blood vessels (neovascularization) that can leak fluid and distort vision. These changes can significantly affect a person's ability to drive safely, as they may struggle with tasks such as reading road signs, recognizing pedestrians or other vehicles, and maintaining proper lane positioning. Additionally, AMD can cause permanent central visual acuity loss, which can further hinder driving abilities. Treatments like anti-VEGF injections and anti-VEGF therapy have been shown to improve visual acuity and potentially restore some driving capabilities, but the condition remains a significant concern for older drivers and their families.","
