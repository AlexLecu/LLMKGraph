Is AMD caused by infectious agents? a) Yes b) No c) Sometimes d) Unknown,b) No,"Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a non-infectious condition primarily associated with aging and certain genetic factors. It affects the macula, a small area at the back of the eye responsible for central vision, causing symptoms such as blurred vision, difficulty reading, and driving. AMD can lead to irreversible blindness, general vision loss, and progressive loss of central vision. While it is not caused by infectious agents, it can be aggravated by factors like age and ethnicity. Some subtypes of AMD, such as neovascularization, are present in the retina and can cause exudation, subretinal drusenoid deposits, and polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.

While the Macula, responsible for central vision, is affected and can lead to vision loss, the Optic Nerve is generally spared in the progression of AMD. The Choroid, a layer of blood vessels beneath the RPE, is affected due to the presence of drusen, a deposit under the RPE, and the over-activation of the complement cascade. The progression of AMD is aggravated by drusen-related progression and can cause atrophy in the RPE. The Choroid also affects the RPE, and both components are interconnected in the pathogenesis of AMD. The RPE, in turn, can affect the Choroid.

This condition is a result of the progressive degeneration of the Retinal Pigment Epithelium (RPE) and the underlying Choroid, leading to a loss of photoreceptor cells. GA is present in advanced AMD and is associated with a significant decline in central vision. Age is a significant factor in the development and progression of GA, as it causes choroidal atrophy and RPE tear, which in turn lead to the onset of GA. The size of the lesion and the baseline visual acuity also affect the final visual acuity in patients with GA.

This condition is often associated with exudative AMD, which also exhibits abnormal blood vessel growth. The growth of these vessels is caused by factors such as retinal hypoxia, the expression of certain proteins like VEGFR2, and the presence of leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1. Treatment for wet AMD typically involves intravitreal injections of drugs like aflibercept and bevacizumab.

While there is no complete cure for late-stage AMD, treatments such as bilateral same-day intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, sing-IMT implantation, and rehabilitation training can help improve symptoms and slow down the progression of the disease. Some medications, like faricimab, may offer complete dryness for dry AMD, but these are not effective for late-stage AMD. Dietary factors, such as lower intakes of vitamins E, C, and beta-carotene, as well as lower proportions of patients meeting recommended vegetable intake, can contribute to the development and progression of late-stage AMD. Metabolic syndromes, obesity, high glucose, and high triglycerides are also associated with an increased risk of late-stage AMD. Regular exercise, particularly frequent vigorous exercise, may help prevent late-stage AMD, while smoking is a known risk factor.

Can AMD occur in infants? a) Yes b) No c) Rarely d) Only genetically,b) No,"Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a condition primarily affecting adults, particularly those in older age groups. It is characterized by damage to the macula, a part of the retina responsible for central vision. This damage can lead to symptoms such as blurred vision, difficulty reading, and driving, as well as more serious consequences like irreversible blindness and progressive loss of vision. AMD is often associated with other age-related conditions like neurodegenerative disorders and retinal vascular diseases. Factors such as smoking, obesity, and high cholesterol levels are known to increase the risk of AMD. While there are currently no cures for AMD, treatments like anti-VEGF injections and photodynamic therapy can help manage the condition and slow its progression. It's worth noting that while AMD is rare in infants, genetic factors can play a role in its development, with certain variants increasing the risk, such as the variant b cystatin C.

This loss of vision can have a profound psychological impact, as it may lead to depression. The association between AMD and depression is not causal, but rather, AMD can aggravate or present depression. This psychological challenge may stem from the frustration, difficulty in reading, and emotional affects that come with the loss of vision. Additionally, the fear of falling, which is common among the elderly, can also contribute to depression.

Which retinal event occurs in wet AMD? a) Drusen reduction b) Subretinal hemorrhage c) Optic atrophy d) Lens detachment,b) Subretinal hemorrhage,"Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a severe form of AMD characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the retina, known as choroidal neovascularization. This event is caused by the overactivity of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The most common retinal event in wet AMD is the development of subretinal hemorrhage, which can lead to vision loss and macular scarring. Treatment for wet AMD typically involves the use of anti-VEGF drugs, such as aflibercept, ranibizumab, and bevacizumab, which are administered intravitreally. These drugs help reduce the growth of new blood vessels and improve vision. However, they do not address the underlying cause of the disease, which is the presence of drusen, deposits under the retina. Drusen are associated with the risk of progression to sight-threatening AMD and can affect the retinal architecture.

This is due to the abnormal growth of new blood vessels under the retina, a process known to be aggravated by inflammation. The disease is associated with impaired autophagy, a cellular process that becomes dysfunctional with age, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the retina. This impaired autophagy can be caused by various factors, including inflammation and genetic predisposition. The disease can lead to severe vision loss and, if left untreated, irreversible blindness. Treatment options include intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF drugs, such as aflibercept, ranibizumab, and brolucizumab, which help control the growth of new blood vessels and reduce the treatment burden.
