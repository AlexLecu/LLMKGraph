How does smoking contribute to AMD progression?,"['Smoking significantly contributes to the progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). This is because smoking can cause AMD, aggravate its development, and increase the risk of late AMD. Smoking also affects the features and pathology of AMD, including the macula and the risk of vision loss. Furthermore, smoking can cause various eye disorders such as cataracts and dry eye disease, which may also contribute to AMD. On the other hand, smoking cessation can prevent or treat certain forms of AMD, such as neovascular AMD, and may help slow down the progression of geographic atrophy and glaucoma. However, current smoking aggravates AMD, potentially leading to early progression of the disease.

As a result, individuals with late AMD have difficulty seeing what they are looking at directly, which can lead to spatial disorientation. This disorientation can further affect their ability to navigate, maintain postural control, and perform locomotion tasks. Additionally, late AMD can impact wayfinding capabilities, as individuals may struggle to understand their spatial relationships and orientation in their environment. It's important to note that these issues are not solely due to the visual impairment, but also because spatial orientation relies on high-level brain functions, multimodal sensory processing, and the integration of various sensory inputs. While there are treatments available for late AMD, such as rehabilitation training, implantation of certain devices, and dietary interventions, the disorientation can persist if the visual impairment is not adequately addressed.""]", Spatial disorientation in late AMD is primarily caused by the visual impairment and loss of central vision that characterizes this condition.,"Central vision loss disrupts depth cues, causing spatial disorientation in late AMD.",0.7307020613003413,1.0000000000000002,0.9227651126839872,1.0,0.9999999999,1.0

What causes AI to refine AMD diagnosis?,"['Artificial Intelligence (AI) refines AMD diagnosis by leveraging advanced diagnostic tools and models. AI can present, diagnose, and improve the prediction accuracy of AMD, as well as other eye conditions such as cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. AI also improves the utility of retinal scanning, surgical skill training, and telehealth, making diagnosis more accessible and efficient. Furthermore, AI can affect treatment pathways, improve the accuracy, speed, and workflow of diagnoses, and personalize care for patients with AMD. AI models can also treat AMD, improve the progression of the disease, and affect the development of AMD, contributing to the overall management and prevention of this vision-threatening condition.']"," AI refines AMD diagnosis by leveraging advanced diagnostic tools and models, improving the accuracy, speed, and workflow of diagnoses.","AI detects retinal anomalies, refining AMD diagnosis precision.",0.43762783978981973,0.9459226608290621,0.8933685020164217,1.0,0.9999999999,1.0
How does vascular dilation aggravate AMD damage?,"['Vascular dilation, particularly in the choroid and retina, plays a significant role in aggravating damage in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). This is due to the presence of conditions such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and focal vascular dilation, which are associated with AMD. These vascular abnormalities can lead to neovascularization, exudation, and irreversible blindness. Additionally, age and certain genetic factors can aggravate AMD, making older individuals and certain ethnicities more susceptible. While current therapies can help manage AMD, there are no cures yet, and the disease can cause progressive loss of central vision, affecting daily activities like driving, reading, and even emotional well-being. Innovative treatments, such as the transplantation of functional retinal pigment epithelium cells and intravitreally applied epidermal growth factor, are being researched to prevent and treat AMD-related damage.']"," Vascular dilation, particularly in the choroid and retina, aggravates AMD damage by promoting conditions such as polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy and focal vascular dilation, which can lead to neovascularization, exudation, and irreversible blindness.","Vascular dilation boosts leakage, aggravating AMD damage.",0.3942371502341949,0.9798033973110029,0.9102819342701131,0.7142857142857143,0.9999999999,0.0
Why does AMD impair meal prep skills?,"[""Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) primarily affects the central vision, causing symptoms such as blurred vision, difficulty reading, and poor spatial perception mobility. This condition can lead to general vision loss, central vision loss, and even blindness, making tasks like meal prep skills more challenging. AMD is often associated with aging, and certain factors like ethnicity and genetics can aggravate its progression. AMD is also linked to neurodegenerative disorders, which may further impact an individual's ability to perform complex tasks. Additionally, AMD can cause emotional affects like frustration, and it may affect driving performance and safety ratings, potentially leading to errors at traffic intersections. While there are current therapies available to manage AMD, there are no cures for the disease at this time, making it a significant health concern among the elderly population.""]"," AMD impairs meal prep skills due to the loss of central vision, making it difficult to see and manipulate food items accurately.","Central vision loss reduces detail perception, impairing meal prep skills in AMD.",0.6532556560952353,0.9522680629462169,0.8987369100952268,0.5,0.9999999999,1.0
