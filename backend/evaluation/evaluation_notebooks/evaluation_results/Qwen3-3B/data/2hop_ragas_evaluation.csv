Why does wet AMD lead to rapid vision loss?,"['Wet age-related macular degeneration leads to rapid vision loss primarily due to the development of abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina, a process known as choroidal neovascularization. These fragile vessels leak fluid and blood into the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision. This leakage damages the surrounding retinal tissue, including the photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium, leading to swift and severe central vision loss. Unlike the dry form, which progresses slowly, the wet form is characterized by active vascular growth and inflammation, causing irreversible damage that deteriorates vision rapidly over time. Treatments such as anti-VEGF therapies can help slow progression by reducing leakage, but they do not reverse the damage already done, highlighting the urgency of early detection and intervention.']","Wet AMD leads to rapid vision loss because abnormal blood vessels beneath the retina leak fluid and blood into the macula, damaging critical retinal cells and causing swift, severe central vision loss.","Wet AMD causes abnormal blood vessels to leak fluid or blood, damaging the macula and rapidly impairing central vision.",0.9916276719168512,,0.9665275032522709,1.0,0.9999999999,1.0
