What is the primary area of the eye affected by AMD?,"['Age-related macular degeneration primarily affects the macula, a small central region of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision. This condition leads to progressive loss of central vision, making it difficult to read, drive, and perform everyday tasks that require fine visual detail. The disease involves damage to the retinal pigment epithelium and the underlying retinal layers, resulting in the formation of drusen, subretinal deposits, and in some cases, abnormal blood vessel growth. It is strongly associated with aging, genetic factors such as the apoe4 variant, and systemic conditions like inflammation and cardiovascular risk, all of which contribute to its development and progression. While it does not typically affect peripheral vision, its impact on central vision significantly impairs quality of life and independence in older adults.']","Age-related macular degeneration primarily affects the macula, a small central region of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision.","The macula, located in the central retina, is primarily affected by AMD.",0.9777825552604268,,0.9111302210417073,1.0,0.9999999999,1.0
What distinguishes wet AMD from dry AMD?,"['Wet age-related macular degeneration is distinguished from dry AMD by the presence of abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina, leading to leakage, bleeding, and rapid vision loss, whereas dry AMD involves the gradual accumulation of drusen and progressive degeneration of retinal cells without vascular involvement. Wet AMD often presents with sudden visual symptoms such as blurred vision, distortion, and central vision loss due to exudation and fluid buildup, and it is typically more aggressive and potentially irreversible. In contrast, dry AMD progresses slowly, primarily affecting the macula through the buildup of drusen and atrophy of retinal pigment epithelial cells, resulting in a gradual decline in central vision. Treatments for wet AMD focus on inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor to stop abnormal vessel formation, while dry AMD management is currently limited to supportive therapies and lifestyle interventions aimed at slowing disease progression.']","Wet AMD is distinguished from dry AMD by the presence of abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina, leading to leakage, bleeding, and rapid vision loss, whereas dry AMD involves gradual accumulation of drusen and progressive degeneration of retinal cells without vascular involvement.","Wet AMD involves abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage, while dry AMD features drusen deposits and retinal thinning.",0.9898960899245779,,0.9595843596983116,1.0,0.9999999999,0.5
What are drusen in the context of AMD?,"['Drusen are abnormal deposits that accumulate beneath the retina, particularly in the macula, and are a hallmark feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). These deposits are commonly observed in the early stages of the disease and are closely associated with the progressive deterioration of central vision. The presence of drusen is often detected through retinal imaging and is linked to both the development and progression of AMD, contributing to symptoms such as blurred vision, difficulty reading, and impaired visual acuity. While drusen themselves may not always cause immediate vision loss, their accumulation over time increases the risk of more severe forms of AMD, including geographic atrophy and neovascularization, which can lead to irreversible vision loss and significant functional decline in daily activities like driving and recognizing faces.']","Drusen are abnormal deposits that accumulate beneath the retina, particularly in the macula, and are a hallmark feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), closely associated with both its development and progression.",Drusen are yellowish deposits of lipids and proteins that accumulate under the retina in dry AMD.,0.8360019467152758,,0.9440077868611029,1.0,0.0,0.0
