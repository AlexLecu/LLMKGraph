The underlying mechanisms involve the disruption of normal retinal function and the promotion of neovascularization, a hallmark of AMD. As a result, vascular dilation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis and progression of AMD, underscoring the importance of understanding its mechanisms in order to develop effective treatments and prevent further vision loss.']","Vascular dilation, particularly choroidal vascular dilation, exacerbates AMD damage by disrupting normal retinal function and promoting neovascularization, a hallmark of the disease."
Why does AMD impair meal prep skills?,"Central vision loss reduces detail perception, impairing meal prep skills in AMD.","['Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) significantly impairs meal prep skills due to its impact on central vision, which is crucial for spatial perception and mobility. As AMD progresses, individuals experience difficulty with tasks that require precise visual attention, such as navigating kitchen spaces, reading recipes, and handling food. This visual impairment leads to frustration, emotional affects, and a dependency on others for daily tasks, ultimately affecting their ability to prepare meals independently. The progressive loss of vision and visual impairment caused by AMD make everyday activities, including meal preparation, increasingly challenging, resulting in a decline in spatial perception and mobility.']","Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) impairs meal prep skills due to its impact on central vision, which is crucial for spatial perception and mobility."
